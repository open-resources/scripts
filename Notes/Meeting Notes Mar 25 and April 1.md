# OER Scripts Meeting April 1
Present: MK, GB, FM

Do we need a dedicated imports section? Or OK to place at the top of the ### solution section?
-It’s ok. Let’s not use ### anymore though. 

How do we bill our time?
-On Workday

How do we make a question pool in PL? 
-TBD

## Action Items
-MK/GB Have a metadata list/dict/json format rather than a section

-MK/GB Populate some metadata using csv . Select questions/difficulty/learning outcome in x framework then able to just export. Portable

-FM Dynamic Image randomization such as Train with carts and string randomization 

-MK/GB How do we make a question pool in PL? 

# OER Scripts Meeting March 25
Present: MK, GB

Notes:
How do we deal with multiple answers to a question? 
-We will have an “answers” object which lists the variable name for each answer.

How do we deal with complicated answers? (Such as filtering out a negative time.)
-There will be python script basically copypasted into the md file. It will have a “variables” list, and an “answers” list which has the variable name of each variable and answer.

List of allowed imports? (check PL support)
-We’ll have to check or try out different packages in PL.

Move solution to calc section, solution is just variable name

We will split up coding tasks once the code is big enough to split into different files. 

## Tasks for next week:
MK to re-edit md files for a new structure, and add a comments/documentation section. 
GB to keep building out code.
