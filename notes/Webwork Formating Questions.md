1. Is it possible to view this example question in WebWork? (ie. a screenshot would be useful)


2. Is there any way we can figure out the problem type from the webwork syntax? i.e through the loaded Macros? Can we rely on all the loaded macros for each problem to be necessary (and sufficient) for the problem to render?

3. Are the macros useful / do we need them? 

   >  Line 20:

   ```perl
   loadMacros( "PGbasicmacros.pl",
                   "MathObjects.pl",
   	        "PGauxiliaryFunctions.pl",
   	        "PGchoicemacros.pl",
   	        "PGanswermacros.pl",
                   "PG_CAPAmacros.pl",
       		"BrockPhysicsMacros.pl"
   );
   ```
4. We have found a python package that purportedly converts PERL syntax to python. Would this be useful here? [Pythonize](http://www.softpanorama.org/Scripting/Pythonorama/Python_for_perl_programmers/Pythonizer/index.shtml). If so, at what point in the document should we send the code through the PERL processor?

5. How is latex handled on lines 47, 59 & 72?

  > Line 47:  `\( 100 \,\textrm{m}\)`
  >
  > Line 59:  `\(t=5 \,\textrm{s}\)`
  >
  > Line 72:  `\{ans_rule(40)\} \(\textrm{m/s}^2\)`

6. How is latex handled on line 44-45? 

   ```perl
   \{ image( "NU_U17-2-08-007.png", width=>354, height=>225,  
   tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Figure 1"' ) \}
   ```

7. On line 42, there is a `<strong>` tag, does this part appear as bold in WebWork? If so, does WebWork support HTML tags? 

   ```html
   <strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>
   ```

8. How do hints appear on WebWork? (Hint is shown above on line 42)

9. Can hints include latex?
