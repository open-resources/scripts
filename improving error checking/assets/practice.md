# {{ params.vars.title }}

A {{ params.vars.vehicle }} moves {{ params.c1}} blocks due {{ params.dir1}}, {{ params.c2 }} blocks due {{ params.dir2}}, and another {{ params.c3 }} blocks due {{ params.dir3}}. 

## Question Text

Assume all blocks are of equal size. What is the magnitude of the {{ params.vars.vehicle }}'s displacement, start to finish?

### Answer Section

Please enter in a numeric value in {{ params.vars.units }}.
