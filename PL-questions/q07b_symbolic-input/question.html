	<markdown>{{ params.vars.name }} is driving a {{ params.vars.vehicle }} up a slope of angle $\theta$.

There is a wooden crate in the back of the {{ params.vars.vehicle }} and the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the crate and the {{ params.vars.vehicle }} are $\mu_s$ and $\mu_k$ respectively.

If the {{ params.vars.vehicle }} starts moving, what is the maximum acceleration the {{ params.vars.vehicle }} can have without the crate slipping? You should provide a symbolic answer in terms of the following variables: $\mu_s$, $\mu_k$, $g$, and $\theta$.

Note that it may not be necessary to use every variable. For $\mu_s$, enter "mu_s", for $\mu_k$, enter "mu_k", for $g$, enter "g", and for $\theta$, enter "theta".
