  #Note. One may be tempted to "import sympy" instead of "from sympy import *". This will work with simple multiplication/division, addition, and subtraction however this makes the sin and cos require sympy.sin and sympy.cos, which is messy. 
  #Of course, if you are using "from numpy import *" as well, this will may cause errors, so use caution.

  # Declare math symbols
  mu_s, g , theta = symbols('mu_s g theta')

  # Describe the equation
  amax = g*(mu_s*cos(theta) - sin(theta))

  # Answer to fill in the blank input stored as JSON.
