# Scripts

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with the scripts for this project. It will eventually be deprecated in favour of the python package: https://github.com/open-resources/problem_bank_scripts

The md_files_standards gives example question file types.

To run `md-to-pl`:

```
python md-to-pl.py md_file_standards/q01_multiple-choice/q01_multiple-choice.md PL-questions
```

The output will be in the `PL-questions` directory.
