## Question Section 

Suppose the rotating disk shown above has a mass of 50.0 g, radius of 0.015 m, an initial velocity of 30.0 ms and is spinning clockwise at(1000) rpm when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg.
a) What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision?
ans_rule(40) rads
b) What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?
ans_rule(40) J
c) What is the total linear momentum before and after the collision?
ans_rule(40) kg ms

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 1.05
Lafter = 1.800589
radius = 1.5
Inertia = 1.032
angularvelocity = Lafter/Inertia
KineticEnergy = 0.5*Inertia*(angularvelocity**2)
linearmomentum = mass*1.2*angularvelocity
