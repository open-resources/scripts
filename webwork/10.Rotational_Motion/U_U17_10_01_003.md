## Question Section 

You have a grindstone (a disk) that is(mass) kg, has a(radius)-m radius, and is turning at(velocityrpm) rpm, and you press a steel axe against it with a radial force of(N) N. 
a) Assuming the kinetic coefficient of friction between steel and stone is(uk), calculate the angular acceleration of the grindstone. 
b) How many turns will the stone make before coming to rest?
