## Question Section 

Consider the father pushing a playground merry-go-round as pictured above. He exerts a force of(ForceN) on the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a(radiusm) radius. Consider the merry-go-round itself to be a uniform disk with negligible retarding friction.
a) How long does it take the father to give the merry-go-round and his 18.0-kg child an angular velocity of(angularvelocity) rads? 
ans_rule(40) s
b) How many revolutions must he go through to generate this velocity? 
ans_rule(40) rev
c) If he exerts a slowing force of the same magnitude, how long would it take him to stop them?
ans_rule(40) s

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

radius = randrange(1.47,1.99,0.01)
angularvelocity = randrange(1.25,1.95,0.01)
Force = randrange(300,400,1)
T = radius*Force
I = 0.5*(50+18)*(radius)**2
aa = ((radius*Force)/(0.5*(68)*radius**2))
timea = angularvelocity/(aa)
theta = ((angularvelocity**2)/(2*(aa)))*(1/(2*pi))
timec = (angularvelocity*I)/(radius*Force)
