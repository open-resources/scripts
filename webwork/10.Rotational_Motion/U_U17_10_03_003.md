## Question Section 

The triceps muscle in the back of the upper arm extends the forearm. This muscle in a
professional boxer exerts a force of(Ftimes 10^3) N with an effective perpendicular lever arm of(radius) cm, producing an angular acceleration of the forearm of(angularaccelerationrads^2). What is the moment of inertia of the boxer's forearm?
ans_rule(40)(kg m^2)
