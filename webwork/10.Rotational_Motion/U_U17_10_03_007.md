## Question Section 

Zorch, an archenemy of Superman, decides to slow Earth's rotation to once per(28.0) h by exerting an opposing force at and parallel to the equator. Superman is not immediately concerned, because he knows Zorch can only exert a force of(4.00times 10^7) N (a little greater than a Saturn V rocket's thrust). How long must Zorch push with this force to accomplish his goal? (This period gives Superman time to devote to other villains.)
ans_rule(40) s


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

velocityo = 7.272*(10**-5)
velocity = 6.233*(10**-5)
mass = 5.979*(10**24)
radius = 6.376*(10**6)
Force = -4*(10**7)
time = (2*(velocity-velocityo)*mass*radius)/(5*Force)
