## Question Section 

During a very quick stop, a car decelerates at(acceleration1ms^2). 
a) What is the angular acceleration of its(radius)-m-radius tires, assuming they do not slip on the pavement?
b) How many revolutions do the tires make before coming to rest, given their initial
angular velocity is(angularvelocity) rads? 
ans_rule(40) rev
c) How long does the car take to stop completely? 
ans_rule(40) s
 
d) What distance does the car travel in this time? 
ans_rule(40) m
  
e) What was the car's initial velocity?
ans_rule(40) ms

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

acceleration1 = randrange(7,9,0.01)
radius = randrange(0.17,0.29,0.001)
angularvelocity = randrange(85,95,1)
angularacceleration = -acceleration1/radius
theta = -((angularvelocity**2)/(2*(angularacceleration)))*(1/(2*pi))
time = -angularvelocity/angularacceleration
x = radius*(theta*2*pi)
velocityo = radius*angularvelocity
