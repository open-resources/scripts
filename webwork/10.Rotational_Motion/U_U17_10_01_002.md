## Question Section 

Integrated Concepts An ultracentrifuge accelerates from rest to(velocityrpm) rpm in(minutes) min. 
a) What is its angular acceleration in(rads^2)? 
b) What is the tangential acceleration of a point(radius) cm from the axis of rotation?
c) What is the radial acceleration in(ms^2)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

minutes = randrange(2,3,0.1)
time = minutes*60
velocityrpm = randrange(100000,106000,1)
velocity = velocityrpm*((2*pi)/60)
angularacceleration = velocity/time
radius = randrange(7,9.8,0.01)
tangentialacceleration = (radius/100)*angularacceleration
radialacceleration = (radius/100)*(velocity**2)
