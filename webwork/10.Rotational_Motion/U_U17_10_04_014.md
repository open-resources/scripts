## Question Section 

In softball, the pitcher throws with the arm fully extended (straight at the elbow). In a fast pitch the ball leaves the hand with a speed of(velocitykmh) kmh. 
a) Find the rotational kinetic energy of the pitcher's arm given its moment of inertia is(Inertia)(kg m^2) and the ball leaves the hand at a distance of(length) m from the pivot at the shoulder. 
ans_rule(40) J
b) What force did the muscles exert to cause the arm to rotate if their effective perpendicular lever arm is(radiusb) cm and the ball is(massb) kg?
ans_rule(40) N

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

velocitykmh = randrange(130,140,1)
massb = randrange(0.142,0.180,0.001)
gravity = 9.8
length = randrange(0.6,0.699,0.001)
radiusb = randrange(2.2,4.6,0.1)
Inertia = 0.720
KineticEnergy = 0.5*((Inertia+(massb*(length**2)))*((velocitykmh*(1000/3600))/length)**2)
Mass = (3*Inertia)/(length**2)
Force = (KineticEnergy-(((mass*length)+(Mass*(length/2)))*gravity))/((radiusb/100)*(pi/2))
