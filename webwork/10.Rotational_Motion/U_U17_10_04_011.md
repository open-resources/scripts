## Question Section 

Consider two cylinders that start down identical inclines from rest except that one is frictionless. Thus one cylinder rolls without slipping, while the other slides frictionlessly without rolling. They both travel a short distance at the bottom and then start up another incline. 
a) Show (on your own) that they both reach the same height on the other incline, and that this height is equal to their original height (this will help you answer the following question). 
b) Find the ratio of the time the rolling cylinder takes to reach the height on the second incline to the time the sliding cylinder takes to reach the height on the second incline.

showHints = 3

ratio = sqrt(3/2)
