## Question Section 

Starting with the formula for the moment of inertia of a rod rotated around an axis
through one end perpendicular to its length ((I = Ml^23)), prove that the moment of
inertia of a rod rotated about an axis through its center perpendicular to its length is
(I = Ml^212). You will find the graphics in Figure 10.12 useful in visualizing these
rotations.
ans_rule(40)(ml^2)
