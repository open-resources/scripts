## Question Section 

The axis of Earth makes a(degree ^circ) angle with a direction perpendicular to the plane of Earth's orbit. As shown above, this axis precesses, making one complete rotation in(year) y. 
a) Calculate the change in angular momentum in half this time. 
(s)
b) What is the average torque producing this change in angular momentum? 
ans_rule(40) N m
c) If this torque were created by a single force (it is not) acting at the most effective point on the equator, what would its magnitude be?
ans_rule(40) N

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

degree = 23.5
year = 25780
time = 4.07*(10**11)
L = 7.07*(10**33)
radius = 6.38*(10**6)
angularvelocity = 2*L*sin(degree*(pi/180))
AverageTorque = angularvelocity/time
Torquec = AverageTorque/radius
