## Question Section 

A playground merry-go-round has a mass of(MassWheel) kg and a radius of(radius) m and it is rotating with an angular velocity of(angularvelocity) revs. What is its angular velocity after a(masschild)-kg child gets onto it by grabbing its outer edge? The child is initially at rest.
ans_rule(40) rads


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

MassWheel = randrange(110,160,1)
masschild = randrange(20,30,1)
radius = randrange(1.3,1.9,0.01)
angularvelocity = randrange(0.4,0.6,0.001)
angularmomentum = (MassWheel/(MassWheel+2*masschild))*angularvelocity*2*pi
