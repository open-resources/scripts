## Question Section 

A baseball pitcher throws the ball in a motion where there is rotation of the forearm about the elbow joint as well as other movements. If the linear velocity of the ball relative to the elbow joint is(velocity) ms at a distance of(radius) m from the joint and the moment of inertia of the forearm is(Inertia)(kg m^2) , what is the rotational kinetic energy of the forearm?
ans_rule(40) J


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

velocity = randrange(20,40,1)
Inertia = randrange(0.5,0.6,0.001)
radius = randrange(0.4,0.49,0.001)
KineticEnergy = 0.5*Inertia*((velocity/radius)**2)
