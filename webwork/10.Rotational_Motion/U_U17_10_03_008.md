## Question Section 

An automobile engine can produce(Torque) N·m of torque. Calculate the angular
acceleration produced if(95.0)% of this torque is applied to the drive shaft, axle, and
rear wheels of a car, given the following information. The car is suspended so that the
wheels can turn freely. Each wheel acts like a(mass1) kg disk that has a(radius1) m radius. The walls of each tire act like a(mass2)-kg annular ring that has inside radius of(radius1) m and outside radius of(radius2) m. The tread of each tire acts like a(mass3)-kg hoop of radius(radius3) m. The(mass4)-kg axle acts like a rod that has a(radius4)-cm radius. The(mass5)-kg drive shaft acts like a rod that has a(radius5)-cm radius.
## E
N·m of torque. Calculate the angular
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Torque = randrange(200,300,1)
mass1 = randrange(15,16,0.1)
mass2 = randrange(2,3,0.1)
mass3 = randrange(10,12,0.2)
mass4 = randrange(13,14,0.1)
mass5 = randrange(30,33,0.1)
radius1 = randrange(0.15,0.18,0.01)
radius2 = randrange(0.31,0.32,0.001)
radius3 = randrange(0.33,0.34,0.001)
radius4 = randrange(2,2.2,0.01)
radius5 = randrange(3,3.3,0.01)
Inertia1 = (mass1)*(radius1**2)
Inertia2 = (mass2)*((radius1**2)+(radius2**2))
Inertia3 = 2*(mass3)*(radius3**2)
Inertia4 = 0.5*(mass4)*((radius4/100)**2)
Inertia5 = 0.5*(mass5)*((radius5/100)**2)
Inertia = Inertia1+Inertia2+Inertia3+Inertia4+Inertia5
angularacceleration = 0.95*(Torque/Inertia)
