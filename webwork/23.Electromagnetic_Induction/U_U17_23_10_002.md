### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
taua = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
tauaSI = tau*10**-9
resistancea = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
resistanceaSI = resistance*10**6

taub = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
taubSI = taub*10**-9

inductanceSI = (resistanceSI)*(tauaSI)
resistancebSI = (inductanceSI)/(taubSI)
