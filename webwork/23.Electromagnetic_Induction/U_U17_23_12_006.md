## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have a supply of inductors ranging from(inductance_low)(nH) to(inductance_highSI)(H), and capacitors ranging from(capacitance_low)(pF) to(capacitance_highSI)(F). What is the range of resonant frequencies that can be achieved from combinations of a single inductor and a single capacitor?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
inductance_low = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
inductance_lowSI = inductance_low*10**-9
inductance_highSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
capacitance_low = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
capacitance_lowSI = capacitance_low*10**-12
capacitance_highSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))

frequency_lowSI = (2*pi*sqrt(inductance_highSI*capacitance_highSI))**-1
frequency_highSI = (2*pi*sqrt(inductance_lowSI*capacitance_lowSI))**-1
frequency_high = frequency_highSI*10**-9
