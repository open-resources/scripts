## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a(turns)-turn coil lies in the plane of the page in a uniform magnetic field that is directed into the page. The coil originally has an area of(areaSI)(m^2). It is stretched to have no area in(timeSI)(s). What is the magnitude of the induced emf if the uniform magnetic field has a strength of(strengthSI)(T)?
ans_rule(40)(V)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(45,55,1)
areaSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
timeSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01))

emfSI = (turns*strengthSI*areaSI)/timeSI
