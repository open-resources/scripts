## Question Section 

<b>
Two coils are placed close together in a physics lab to demonstrate Faraday's law of induction. A current of(currentSI)(A) in one is switched off in(time)(ms), inducing a(emfSI)(V) emf in the other. What is their mutual inductance?
ans_rule(40)(mH)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = randrange(4.50,5.50,0.05)
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8.5,9.5,0.05))

inductanceSI = (emfSI*timeSI)/(currentSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
