## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A bicycle generator with a(turns)-turn coil is driven by a(diameter) cm diameter wheel that rolls on the outside rim of the bicycle tire.
a) What is the velocity of the bicycle if the generator's angular velocity is(omegaA)(rads)?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(45,55,1)
diameter = randrange(1.55,1.65,0.01)
radiusSI = diameter/200

omegaA = randrange(1870,1880,1)
emfSIA = randrange(17.5,18.5,0.1)

speedSIB = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)

speedSIC = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
emfSIC = randrange(8.95,9.05,0.01)
areaC= randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
areaSIC = areaC*10**-4


speedSIA = radiusSI*omegaA
emfSIB = emfSIA*(speedSIB/speedSIA)
strengthSIC = emfSIC/((speedSIC/radiusSI)*turns*areaSIC)
