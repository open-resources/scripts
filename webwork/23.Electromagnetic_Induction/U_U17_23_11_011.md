## Question Section 

<b>
A certain type of capacitor is designed to filter high-frequency signals by shorting them to earthground.
a) What capacitance is needed to produce a reactance of(reactance_a) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>m&Omega;<span> for a(frequency_a)(kHz) signal?
ans_rule(40)(mF)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
reactance_a = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
reactance_aSI = reactance_a*10**-3
frequency_a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
frequency_aSI = frequency_a*10**3
frequency_bSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))

capacitanceSI = (2*pi*frequency_aSI*reactance_aSI)**-1
capacitance = capacitanceSI*10**3
reactance_bSI = (2*pi*frequency_bSI*capacitanceSI)**-1
