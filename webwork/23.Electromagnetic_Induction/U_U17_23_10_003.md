## Question Section 

<b>
A large superconducting magnet, used for magnetic resonance imaging, has a(inductanceSI)(H) inductance. If you want current through it to be adjustable with a(tauSI)(s) characteristic time constant, what is the minimum resistance of system?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(47.5,52.5,0.1))
tauSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))

resistanceSI = inductanceSI/tauSI
