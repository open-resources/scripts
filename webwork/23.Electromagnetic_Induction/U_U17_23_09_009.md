### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mu = 4*pi*10**-7
diameter = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01))
lengthSI = length*10**-2
halfturns = randrange(250,275,1)
turns = 2*halfturns
currentSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1))
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3

inductanceSI = (mu*(turns**2)*areaSI)/(lengthSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
inductanceCSI = 0
