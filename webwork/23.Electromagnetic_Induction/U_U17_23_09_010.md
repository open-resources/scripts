### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
mu = 4*pi*10**-7
diameter = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.750,0.850,0.001))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
lengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
turns = randrange(380,420,10)
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01))
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3

inductanceSI = (mu*(turns**2)*areaSI)/(lengthSI)
energySI = 0.5*inductanceSI*(currentSI**2)
emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
emf = emfSI*10**3
