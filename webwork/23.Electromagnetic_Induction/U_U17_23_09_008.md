### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mu = 4*pi*10**-7
length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,55,0.5))
lengthSI = length*10**-2
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
radiusSI = (diameter)/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
loops = randrange(950,1050,10)
currentSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))

inductanceSI = (mu*(loops**2)*areaSI)/(lengthSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
energySI = 0.5*inductanceSI*(currentSI**2)
timeSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/emfSI
