## Question Section 

<b>
A jet airplane with a(lengthSI)(m) wingspan is flying at(speedSI)(ms). What emf is induced between wing tips if the vertical component of the Earth's field is(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T)?
ans_rule(40)(V)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
lengthSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(74.5,75.5,0.1))
speedSI = randrange(270,290,2)
strength= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))
strengthSI = strength*10**-5

emfSI = (speedSI*strengthSI*lengthSI)
