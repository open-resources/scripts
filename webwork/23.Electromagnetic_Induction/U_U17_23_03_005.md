## Question Section 

<b>
At what speed must a sliding rod move to produce an emf of(emfSI)(V) in a(strengthSI)(T) field, given the rod's length is(length)(cm)?
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01))
length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(29.5,30.5,0.1))
lengthSI = length/100

speedSI = (emfSI)/(strengthSI*lengthSI)
