## Question Section 

<b>
A Tethered Satellite is(length)(km) long, producing(voltage)(kV), and a current of(currentSI)(A) flows, in the Earth's(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T) field.
a) What magnetic drag force does this produce if the system is moving at(speed)(kms)?
ans_rule(40)(N)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
lengthSI = length*10**3
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
voltageSI = voltage*10**3
currentSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
strength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
strengthSI = strength*10**-5
speed = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.70,7.90,0.01))
speedSI = speed*10**3
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
timeSI = time*3600
massSI = randrange(95000,105000,1000)

forceSI = (lengthSI*currentSI*strengthSI)
deltaKE = (forceSI*speedSI*timeSI)
speed2SI = sqrt(-(2/massSI)*deltaKE+(speedSI**2))
deltaspeedSI = speed2SI-speedSI
