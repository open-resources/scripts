### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mu = 4*pi*10**-7
diameterSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
radiusSI = diameterSI/2
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
distanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1))
current = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
currentSI = current*10**6
strengthSI = (mu*currentSI)/(2*pi*distanceSI)
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1))
timeSI = time*10**-6

emfSI = (strengthSI*areaSI)/(timeSI)
