## Question Section 

<b>
To receive AM radio, you want an RLC circuit that can be made to resonate at any frequency between(frequency_low)(kHz) and(frequency_high)(kHz). This is accomplished with a fixed(inductance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;H<span> inductor connected to a variable capacitor. What range of capacitance is needed?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
frequency_low = randrange(490,510,1)
frequency_lowSI = frequency_low*10**3
frequency_high = randrange(1625,1675,1)
frequency_highSI = frequency_high*10**3
inductance = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-6

capacitance_lowSI = (inductanceSI*(2*pi*frequency_highSI)**2)**-1
capacitance_low = capacitance_lowSI*10**9
capacitance_highSI = (inductanceSI*(2*pi*frequency_lowSI)**2)**-1
capacitance_high = capacitance_highSI*10**9
