### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01))
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1))
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12,13,0.1))
timeSI = time*10**-3

currentSI = emfSI/resistanceSI
tauSI = (inductanceSI)/(resistanceSI)
current_tSI = currentSI*(1-exp((-timeSI)/(tauSI)))
