## Question Section 

<b>
The motor in a toy car operates on(emfSI)(V), developing a(backemfSI)(V) back emf at normal speed. If it draws(current_runningSI)(A) at normal speed, what current does it draw when starting?
ans_rule(40)(V)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01))
backemfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.45,4.55,0.01))
current_runningSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))

resistanceSI = (emfSI-backemfSI)/current_runningSI
current_startingSI = emfSI/resistanceSI
