## Question Section 

<b>
A short circuit to the grounded metal case of an appliance occurs and the person touching the case is wet and only has a(resistance_person) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> resistance to earthground.
a) What is the voltage on the case if(current_person)(mA) flows through the person?
ans_rule(40)(V)
## A
What is the voltage on the case if(current_person)(mA) flows through the person?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resistance_person = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))
resistance_personSI = resistance_person*10**3
current_person = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
current_personSI = current_person*10**-3
resistance_wireSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.195,0.205,0.001))

voltageSI = (current_personSI)*(resistance_personSI)
current_circuitSI = voltageSI/resistance_wireSI
