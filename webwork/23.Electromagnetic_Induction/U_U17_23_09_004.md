## Question Section 

<b>
A device is turned on and(currentSI)(A) flows through it(time)(ms) later. What is the self-inductance of the device if an induced(emfSI)(V) emf opposes this?
ans_rule(40)(mH)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))
time = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
timeSI = time*10**-3
emfSI = randrange(130,170,5)

inductanceSI = (emfSI*timeSI)/(currentSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
