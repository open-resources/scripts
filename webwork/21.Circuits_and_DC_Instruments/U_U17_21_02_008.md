## Question Section 

<b>
The hot resistance of a flashlight bulb is(resbulbSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> , and it is run by a(emfSI)-(V) alkaline cell having a(intresSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> internal resistance.
a) What current flows?
ans_rule(40)(A)
## A
What current flows?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
resbulbSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(2.2,2.4,0.01))
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.54,1.62,0.02))

restotalSI = intresSI+resbulbSI
currentSI = emfSI/(restotalSI)
powerbulbSI = (currentSI**2)*resbulbSI
