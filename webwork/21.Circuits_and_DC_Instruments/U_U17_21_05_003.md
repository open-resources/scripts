## Question Section 

<b>
When an unknown resistance(R)(_x) is placed in a Wheatstone bridge, it is possible to balance the bridge by adjusting(R)(_3) to be(R3) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>. What is (R)(_x) if(fracR_2R_1 =(R2divR1)?
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span>


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
R3SI = randrange(2450,2550,25)
R2divR1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.620,0.630,0.001))

RxSI = (R3*R2divR1)
Rxkohm = RxSI*10**-3
