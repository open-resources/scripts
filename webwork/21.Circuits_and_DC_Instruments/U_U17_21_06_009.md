## Question Section 

<b>
Using the exact exponential treatment, find how much time is required to discharge a(capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F<span> capacitor through a(resistanceSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor down to(percent)(%) of its original voltage.
ans_rule(40)(s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = randrange(220,260,5)
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6
resistanceSI = randrange(490,510,5)
percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
ratio = percent*10**-2

t = resistanceSI*capacitanceSI
timeSI = (-1)*t*log((ratio))
