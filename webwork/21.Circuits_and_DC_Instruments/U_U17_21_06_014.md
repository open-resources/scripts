## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Calculate the capacitance needed to get an RC time constant of(ttimes 10^3)(s) with a(resistanceSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor.
ans_rule(40)(kF)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
tSI = t*10**3
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))

capacitanceSI = (tSI)/(resistanceSI)
capacitancekF = capacitance*10**-3
