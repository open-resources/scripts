## Question Section 

<b>
An automobile starter motor has an equivalent resistance of(resmotorSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> and is supplied by a(emfSI)-(V) battery with a(intresSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> internal resistance.
a) What is the current to the motor?
ans_rule(40)(A)
## A
What is the current to the motor?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resmotorSI = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.0450,0.0550,0.0001))
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(11.5,12.5,0.5))
intresSI = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.0100,0.0150,0.0025))

currentSI = emfSI/(resmotorSI+intresSI)
terminalvoltageSI = emfSI-(currentSI*intresSI)
powermotorSI = ((currentSI**2)*resmotorSI)
powermotorkW = powermotorSI*10**-3
