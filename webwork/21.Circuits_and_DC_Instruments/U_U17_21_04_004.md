## Question Section 

<b>
Find the resistance that must be placed in series with a(resistance1SI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> galvanometer having a(current)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A<span> sensitivity to allow it to be used as a voltmeter with a(emfSI)-(V) full-scale reading.
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resistance1SI = randrange(24,26,1)
current = randrange(47.5,52.5,0.1)
currentSI = current*10**-6
emfSI = randrange(2900,3100,100)

resistance2SI = (emfSI/currentSI)-resistance1SI
resistance2Mohm = resistance2SI/(10**6)
