## Question Section 

<b>
A person with body resistance between his hands of(resbody) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> accidentally grasps the terminals of a(emfline)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> power supply. (Do NOT do this!)
a) If the internal resistance of the power supply is(resintSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>, what is the current through his body?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resbody = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
resbodySI = resbody*10**3
emfline = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(19.5,20.5,0.5))
emflineSI = emfline*10**3
resintSI = randrange(1900,2100,100)
currentsafe = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
currentsafeSI = currentsafe*10**-3

restotalSI = resbodySI+resintSI
currentSI = (emflineSI)/(restotalSI)
powerbodySI = (currentSI**2)*(resbodySI)
resint2SI = ((emflineSI)/(currentsafeSI))-resbodySI
resint2Mohm = resint2SI/(10**6)
