## Question Section 

<b>
Using the exact exponential treatment, find how much time is required to charge an initially uncharged(capacitance)-(pF) capacitor through a(resistance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;<span> resistor to(percent)(%) of its final voltage.
ans_rule(40)(s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = randrange(95,110,1)
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-12
resistance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(74.5,75.5,0.1))
resistanceSI = resistance*10**6
percent = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(89.5,90.5,0.1))
ratio = 1-(percent/100)

t = resistanceSI*capacitanceSI
timeSI = (-1)*t*log(ratio)
