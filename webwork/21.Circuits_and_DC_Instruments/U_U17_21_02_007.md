## Question Section 

<b>
A car battery with a(emfSI)-(V) emf and an internal resistance of(intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> is being charged with a current of(currentSI)(A). Note that in this process the battery is being charged.
a) What is the potential difference across its terminals?
ans_rule(40)(V)
## A
What is the potential difference across its terminals?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = randrange(11,13,1)
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.040,0.060,0.005))
currentSI  = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(55,65,0.1))

terminalvoltageSI = emfSI+(currentSI*intresSI)
thermalpowerSI = (currentSI**2)*intresSI
chemicalpowerSI = (emfSI*currentSI)-thermalpowerSI
