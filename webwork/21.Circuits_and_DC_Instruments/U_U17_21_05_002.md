## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the emf<sub>x<sub> of a dry cell for which a potentiometer is balanced when(R)(_x) =(Rx) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>, while an alkaline standard cell with an emf of(emf)(V) requires(R)(_s) =(Rs) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> to balance the potentiometer.
ans_rule(40)(V)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emf = randrange(1.595,1.605,0.001)
Rx = randrange(1.195,1.205,0.001)
Rs = randrange(1.245,1.249,0.001)

emfx = emf*((Rx)/(Rs))
