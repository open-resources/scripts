## A
Calculate the resistance of the combination?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resammSI = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.0195,0.0205,0.0001))
resistorSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(9.95,10.05,0.01))

seriesresistanceSI = resammSI+resistorSI
decrease = (1-(resistorSI/seriesresistanceSI))*10**2
increase = ((seriesresistanceSI/resistorSI)-1)*10**2
