## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A flashing lamp in a Christmas earring is based on an RC discharge of a capacitor through its resistance. The effective duration of the flash is(timeSI)(s), during which it produces an average(powerSI)(W) from an average(voltageSI)(V).
a) What energy does it dissipate?
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A
What energy does it dissipate?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
timeSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.248,0.260,0.001))
powerSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001))
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))

energySI = powerSI*timeSI
chargeSI = (powerSI/voltageSI)*timeSI
resistanceSI = (voltageSI**2)/(powerSI)
capacitanceSI = (timeSI)/(resistanceSI)
