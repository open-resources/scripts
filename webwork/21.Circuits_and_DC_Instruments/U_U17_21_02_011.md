<b>
A child's electronic toy is supplied by(3),(emfalkSI)-(V) alkaline cells having internal resistances of(resalkSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> in series with a(emfcellSI)-(V) carbon-zinc dry cell having a(rescellSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> internal resistance. The load resistance is(restoySI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> .

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfalkSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.56,1.60,0.02))
emfalktotalSI = 3*emfalkSI
resalkSI = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.02,0.03,0.001))
resalktotalSI = 3*resalkSI
emfcellSI = randrange(1.51,1.55,0.01)
rescellSI = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.01,0.12,0.001))
restoySI =  sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(9.5,10.5,0.5))
powertoynewSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.475,0.525,0.025))

currentSI = (emfalktotalSI+emfcellSI)/(resalktotalSI+rescellSI+restoySI)
powertoyoldSI = (currentSI**2)*restoySI

rescell2SI = (emfalktotalSI+emfcellSI)/(sqrt((powertoynewSI)/(restoySI)))-(restoySI+resalktotalSI)
