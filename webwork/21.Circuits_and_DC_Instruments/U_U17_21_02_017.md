## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> What is the internal resistance of a(emfSI)-(V) dry cell that supplies(loadpowerSI)(W) of power to a(resloadSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> bulb?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.52,1.56,0.01))
loadpowerSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.90,1.10,0.01))
resloadSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14,16,0.5))

currentSI = (loadpowerSI/resloadSI)**(1/2)
intresSI = (emfSI/currentSI)-resloadSI
