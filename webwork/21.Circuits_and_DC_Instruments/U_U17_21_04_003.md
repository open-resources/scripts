## Question Section 

<b>
Find the resistance that must be placed in series with a(resistance1SI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> galvanometer having a(current)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A<span> sensitivity to allow it to be used as a voltmeter with a(emfSI)-(V) full-scale reading.
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span>


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resistance1SI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,30,0.5))
current = randrange(48,52,1)
currentSI = current*10**-6
emfSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.090,0.110,0.001))

resistance2SI = (emfSI/currentSI)-resistance1SI
resistance2kohm = resistance2SI*10**-3
