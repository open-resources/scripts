## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(11,13,0.1))
terminalvoltageSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(15,17,0.5))
currentSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(9,16,0.5))
massSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
heatcap = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.3,0.33,0.001))
heatcapSI = heatcap*4186

resintSI = (terminalvoltageSI-emfSI)/currentSI
powerbatterySI = (currentSI**2)*resintSI
warmingrateSI = powerbatterySI/(massSI*heatcapSI)*60
