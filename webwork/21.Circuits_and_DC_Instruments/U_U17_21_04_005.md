## Question Section 

<b>
Find the resistance that must be placed in parallel with a(resistancegalvSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> galvanometer having a(currentgalv)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A<span> sensitivity to allow it to be used as an ammeter with a(currentscaleSI)-(A) full-scale reading.
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resistancegalvSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(24,26,0.1))
currentgalv = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(47.5,52.5,0.1))
currentgalvSI = currentgalv*10**-6
currentscaleSI = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.5)

resistancescaleSI = (currentgalvSI*resistancegalvSI)/(currentscaleSI)
