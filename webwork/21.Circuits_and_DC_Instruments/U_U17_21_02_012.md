## Question Section 

<b>
What is the internal resistance of a voltage source if its terminal voltage drops by(deltaemfSI)(V) when the current supplied increases by(deltacurrentSI)(A)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
deltaemfSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(1.5,2.5,0.25))
deltacurrentSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(4.5,5.5,0.25))

intresSI= deltaemfSI/deltacurrentSI
