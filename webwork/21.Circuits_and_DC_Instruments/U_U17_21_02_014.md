## Question Section 

<b>
Electric fish generate current with biological cells called electroplaques, which are physiological emf devices. The electroplaques in the South American eel are arranged in(140) rows, each row stretching horizontally along the body and each containing(5000) electroplaques. Each electroplaque has an emf of(0.15)(V) and internal resistance of(0.25) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> . If the water surrounding each row of electroplaques has resistance of(RwaterSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>, how much current can the eel produce in water from near its head to near its tail?
ans_rule(40)(A)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfeqSI = 0.15*5000
RrowSI = 5000*0.25
ReqSI = 140/RrowSI
RwaterSI = randrange(800,810,1)

currentSI = emfeqSI/(ReqSI+RwaterSI)
