What is the terminal voltage of a large(emfSI)-(V) carbon-zinc dry cell used in a physics lab to supply(currentSI)(A) to a circuit, if the cell's internal resistance is(intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.50,1.75,0.01))
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.90,2.10,0.01))
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.090,0.250,0.005))

terminalvoltageSI = emfSI-(currentSI*intresSI)
totalpowerSI = currentSI*emfSI
loadpowerSI = currentSI*terminalvoltageSI
