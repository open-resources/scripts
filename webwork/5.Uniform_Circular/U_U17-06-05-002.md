## Question Section 

<b>
a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth due to the Moon. Take the mass of the Moon and the distance separating the Earth and Moon to be(7.348times 10^22)(kg) and(3.844times 10^5)(km), respectively.
 
b) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth due to the Sun. Take the mass of the Sun and the distance separating the Earth and Sun to be(1.989times 10^30)(kg) and(1.496times 10^8)(km), respectively.

showHint = 3

g_from_MoonSI = ((6.674*7.348)/(3.844**2))*10**-5
g_from_SunSI = ((6.674*1.989)/(1.496**2))*10**-3
