## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A mountain(radius)(km) from a person exerts a gravitational force on him equal to(percent)(%) of his weight.
a) Calculate the mass of the mountain.
ans_rule(40)(times 10^17)(kg)
## A
Calculate the mass of the mountain.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8
G = 6.674*10**-11

mass_EarthSI = 5.972*10**24
percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,6,1))
radius = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9,10,1))
radiusSI = radius*10**3

ratio = percent*10**-2

mass_mountainSI = ((radiusSI**2)/G)*(g*ratio)
mass_mountain = mass_mountainSI*10**-17
n = (mass_mountainSI)/(mass_EarthSI)
