## Question Section 

<b>
A geosynchronous Earth satellite is one that has an orbital period of precisely one day. Such orbits are useful for communication and weather observation because the satellite remains above the same point on Earth (provided it orbits in the equatorial plane in the same direction as Earth's rotation). Calculate the radius of such an orbit based on the data for the moon.
ans_rule(40)(km)


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

radius = (1.01*10**19/(365.25**2))**(1/3)
