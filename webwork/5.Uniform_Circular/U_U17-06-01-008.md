## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> When kicking a football, the kicker rotates his leg about the hip joint. 
a) If the velocity of the tip of the kicker's shoe is(velocity_shoeSI)(ms) and the hip joint is(leg_radiusSI)(m) from the tip of the shoe, what is the shoe tip's angular velocity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
g = 9.8

ball_massSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.5,0.51,0.005))
impulse_time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(40,45,0.5))
impulse_timeSI = impulse_time*10**-3
leg_radiusSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.2,0.05))
velocity_ballSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(23,25,0.5))
velocity_shoeSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(35,40,0.5))

omega_legSI = (velocity_shoeSI)/(leg_radiusSI)
average_forceSI = (ball_massSI*velocity_ballSI)/(impulse_timeSI)
maximum_rangeSI = (velocity_ballSI**2)/(g)
