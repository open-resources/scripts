## Question Section 

<b>
A baseball pitcher brings his arm forward during a pitch, rotating the forearm about the elbow. If the velocity of the ball in the pitcher's hand is(velocitySI)(ms) and the ball is(arm_radiusSI)(m) from the elbow joint, what is the angular velocity of the forearm? 
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
arm_radiusSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.35,0.4,0.5))
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(35,40,0.5))

omegaSI = (velocitySI)/(arm_radiusSI)
