## Question Section 

a) Background radiation due to(^226Ra) averages only(0.01) mSvy, but it can range 
upward depending on where a person lives. Find the mass of(^226Ra) in the(massbody)-kg body of a man who receives a dose of(2.50)-mSvy from it, noting that each(^226Ra) decay emits a(MeV)-MeV a particle. You may neglect dose due to daughters and assume a constant amount, evenly distributed due to balanced ingestion and bodily elimination.
