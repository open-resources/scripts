## Question Section 

The annual radiation dose from(^14C) in our bodies is(0.01) mSvy. Each(^14C) decay emits a(beta^-) averaging(0.0750) MeV. Taking the fraction of(^14C) to be(1.3times 10^-12) of normal(^12C) and assuming the body is(13)% carbon, estimate the fraction of the decay energy absorbed. (The rest escapes, exposing those close to you.)
