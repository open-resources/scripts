## Question Section 

Integrated Concepts Find the amount of energy given to the(^4)He nucleus and to the(gamma) ray in the reaction(n)+(^3)He->(^4)He+(gamma), using the conservation of momentum principle and taking the reactants to be initially at rest. This should confirm the contention that most of the energy goes to the(gamma) ray.
