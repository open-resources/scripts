## Question Section 

What is the speed of sound in a medium where a(fkHz,(kHz) frequency produces a(gammacm,(cm) wavelength?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

fkHz = randrange(100,150,1)
f = fkHz*1000
gammacm = randrange(5.52,6.23,0.01)
gamma = gammacm/100
v = f*gamma
