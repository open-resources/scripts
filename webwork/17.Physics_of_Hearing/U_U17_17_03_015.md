## Question Section 

If a sound intensity level of(0,(dB) at(1000,(Hz) corresponds to a maximum gauge pressure (sound amplitude) of(10^-9,(atm), what is the maximum gauge pressure in a(dBa,(dB) sound?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

dBa = 60
Ba = 10**(dBa/10)
X2a = (10**-9)*(Ba**(1/2))
dBb = 120
Bb = 10**(dBb/10)
X2b = (10**-9)*(Bb**(1/2))
