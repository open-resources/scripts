## Question Section 

Is(dB,(dB) ultrasound in the range of intensities used for deep heating? Calculate the
intensity of this ultrasound and compare this intensity with values quoted in the text.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dB = randrange(150,160,1)
Io = 1*(10**-12)
I = Io*(10**(dB/10))
