## Question Section 

A spectator at a parade receives an(fobs,(Hz) tone from an oncoming trumpeter who is
playing an(fs,(Hz) note. At what speed is the musician approaching if the speed of
sound is(vw,(ms)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vw = randrange(330,338,1)
fs = randrange(870,880,1)
fobs = randrange(886,889,1)
vs = (vw*(fobs-fs))/fobs
