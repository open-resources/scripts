## Question Section 

What beat frequencies will be present: 
a) If the musical notes A and C are played together (frequencies of(f2a) and(f1a,(Hz) )? 
b) If D and F are played together (frequencies of(f2b) and(f1b,(Hz) )?
## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f1a = randrange(220,230,0.1)
f2a = randrange(260,268,0.1)
fba = abs(f1a-f2a)
f1b = randrange(330,370,0.1)
f2b = randrange(280,298,0.1)
fbb = abs(f1b-f2b)
