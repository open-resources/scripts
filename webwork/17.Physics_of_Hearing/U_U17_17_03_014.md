## Question Section 

The amplitude of a sound wave is measured in terms of its maximum gauge pressure.
By what factor does the amplitude of a sound wave increase if the sound intensity
level goes up by(dB,(dB)?
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


dB = randrange(40,50,10)
B = 10**(dB/10)
X2X1 = B**(1/2)
