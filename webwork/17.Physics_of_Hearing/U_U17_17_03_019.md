## Question Section 

Loudspeakers can produce intense sounds with surprisingly small energy input in spite
of their low efficiencies. Calculate the power input needed to produce a(dB,(dB) sound
intensity level for a(dcm,(cm) diameter speaker that has an efficiency of(efficiency,(%). (This value is the sound intensity level right at the speaker.)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(11,16,1)
A = pi*(((dcm/100)*(1/2))**2)
efficiency = 1.00
dB = 90
I = 10**-3
P = 100*I*A
