## Question Section 

A commuter train blows its(fs,(Hz) horn as it approaches a crossing. The speed of
sound is(vw,(ms). 
a) An observer waiting at the crossing receives a frequency of(fobs,(Hz). What is the speed of the train? 
b) What frequency does the observer receive as the train moves away?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vw = randrange(330,338,1)
fs = randrange(198,200,1)
fobs = randrange(206,209,1)
vs = (vw*(fobs-fs))/fobs
fobsb = fs*(vw/(vw+vs))
