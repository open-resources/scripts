## Question Section 

Sound is more effectively transmitted into a stethoscope by direct contact than through the air, and it is further intensified by being concentrated on the smaller area of the eardrum. It is reasonable to assume that sound is transmitted into a stethoscope(N) times as effectively compared with transmission though the air. What, then, is the gain in decibels produced by a stethoscope that has a sound gathering area of(At,(cm^2), and concentrates the sound onto two eardrums with a total area of(Ae,(cm^2) with an efficiency of(efficiency,(%)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

At = randrange(11,15,1)
Ae = randrange(0.8,0.9,0.001)
efficiency = randrange(40,47,1)
percent = efficiency/100
N = randrange(100,110,1)
I = (percent*At*N)/Ae
B = 10*log10(I)
