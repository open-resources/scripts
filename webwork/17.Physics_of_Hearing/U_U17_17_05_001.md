## Question Section 

A “showy” custom-built car has two brass horns that are supposed to produce the
same frequency but actually emit(f1) and(f2,(Hz). What beat frequency is
produced?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f1 = randrange(262,265,0.1)
f2 = randrange(266,268,0.2)
fb = abs(f1-f2)
