## Question Section 

A bat uses ultrasound to find its way among trees. If this bat can detect echoes
(tms,(ms) apart, what minimum distance between objects can it detect? Assume the temperature is(20^circ(C)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

tms = randrange(1,2,0.01)
t = tms*(10**-3)
vw = 331*sqrt(293.15/273.15)
d = (vw*t)/2
