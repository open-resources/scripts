## Question Section 

Integrated Concepts 
a) During laser vision correction, a brief burst of(193) nm ultraviolet light is projected onto the cornea of the patient. It makes a spot(dmm) mm in diameter and deposits(QmJ) mJ of energy. Calculate the depth of the layer ablated, assuming the corneal tissue has the same properties as water and is initially at(T1C ^circC). The tissue's temperature is increased to(T2C ^circC) and evaporated without further temperature increase.
