## Question Section 

<b>
A physician's eyes have a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm) and a focal power of(focal_power)(D) while examining a patient. How far from her
eyes is the feature being examined?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(54,55,0.1))
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2

object_distanceSI = (image_distanceSI)/(focal_power*image_distanceSI-1)
