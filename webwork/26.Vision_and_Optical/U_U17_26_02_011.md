### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

far_point = randrange(15,20,1)
far_pointSI = far_point*10**-2
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2

focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1+far_pointSI**-1
std_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1
focal_power_change = std_focal_power-focal_power
