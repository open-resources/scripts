## Question Section 

<b>
What is the angular magnification of a telescope that has a(focal_length_objective)(cm) focal length objective and a(focal_length_eyepiece)(cm) focal length eyepiece?
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_length_eyepiece = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01))
focal_length_objective = randrange(100,110,1)

angular_magnification = -(focal_length_objective/focal_length_eyepiece)
