## Question Section 

<b>
A laser vision correction reshaping the cornea of a myopic patient reduces the
power of his eye by(focal_power_change)(D), with a <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&#177;<span>(ratio)(%) uncertainty in the final correction. What is the range of diopters for spectacle lenses that this person might need after LASIK
procedure?
ans_rule(40)(D)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power_change = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(9,10,0.01))
ratio = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,6,0.1))
uncertainty = ratio/100

focal_power_range = 2*(focal_power_change*uncertainty)
