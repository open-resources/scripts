## Question Section 

<b>
What is the near point of a person whose eyes have an accommodated power of(focal_power)(D), assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm)?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power = randrange(51,52,0.01)
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2

near_pointSI = (image_distanceSI)/(focal_power*image_distanceSI-1)
