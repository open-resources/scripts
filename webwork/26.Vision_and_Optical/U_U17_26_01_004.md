## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a certain person's visual acuity is such that he can see objects clearly that form
an image(image_height) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;m<span> high on his retina. What is the maximum distance at which he can read the(object_height)(cm) high letters on the side of an airplane, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm)?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
image_height = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(4.5,5.5,0.1))
image_heightSI = image_height*10**-6
object_height = randrange(70,80,1)
object_heightSI = object_height*10**-2

object_distanceSI = (image_distanceSI)*(object_heightSI/image_height)
