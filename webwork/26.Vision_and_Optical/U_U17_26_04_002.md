### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

eyepiece_magnification = randrange(6,9,1)
focal_length = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.14,0.160,0.005))
object_distance = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.17,0.19,0.005))

objective_magnification = (1-(object_distance/focal_length))**-1
overall_magnification = (eyepiece_magnification*objective_magnification)
