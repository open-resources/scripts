## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

eyepiece_focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.1,0.01))
lens_spacing = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19,21,1))
objective_focal_length = sprintf("%0.3f", 0.3)
objective_object_distance = sprintf("%0.3f", 0.305)

objective_image_distance = (objective_focal_length*objective_object_distance)/(objective_object_distance-objective_focal_length)
objective_magnification = -(objective_image_distance/objective_object_distance)
eyepiece_object_distance = (lens_spacing-objective_image_distance)
eyepiece_image_distance = (eyepiece_focal_length*eyepiece_object_distance)/(eyepiece_object_distance-eyepiece_focal_length)
eyepiece_magnification = -(eyepiece_image_distance/eyepiece_object_distance)
overall_magnification = (eyepiece_magnification*objective_magnification)
