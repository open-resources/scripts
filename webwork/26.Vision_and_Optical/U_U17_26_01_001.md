## Question Section 

<b>
What is the power of the eye when viewing an object(object_distance)(cm) away, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm)?
ans_rule(40)(D)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
object_distance = randrange(50,60,1)
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

focal_power = object_distanceSI**-1+image_distanceSI**-1
