## Question Section 

One way to force air into an unconscious person's lungs is to squeeze on a balloon appropriately connected to the subject. What force must you exert on the balloon with your hands to create a gauge pressure of(pressure) cm water, assuming you squeeze on an effective area of(area,(cm^2)? There are(98.1,(Nm^2) per(1,(cm) of(H)<sub>2<sub>(O).
## E
cm water, assuming you squeeze on an effective area of(area,(cm^2)? There are(98.1,(Nm^2) per(1,(cm) of(H)<sub>2<sub>(O).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(40,60,0.1)
pressure = randrange(3,5,0.01)

A1 = (pressure)*(98.1)*(area)*(1/10000)
