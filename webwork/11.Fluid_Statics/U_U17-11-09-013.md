## Question Section 

a) To what height could such a negative gauge pressure of(pressure,(atm) raise water? There are(1030,(cm H)<sub>2<sub>(O) per(1,(atm). 
 
b) Assume a steel wire has an initial length of(258,(m). The density of steel is equal to(7800,(kgm^3) and the surface tension is equal to(2.10times 10^11,(Nm^2). How much would this steel wire  stretch if suspended from above?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(20,30,0.1)

A1 = (pressure)*(1030)/100
A2 = (7800)*(9.8)*((A1)**(2))/(2.10*(10**(11)))
