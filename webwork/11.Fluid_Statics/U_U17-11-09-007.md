## Question Section 

If the pressure in the esophagus is(-p1,(mm Hg) while that in the stomach is(+p2,(mm Hg), to what height could stomach fluid rise in the esophagus, assuming a density of(1.10,(gmL)? (This movement will not occur if the muscle closing the lower end of the esophagus is working properly.)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
p1 = randrange(1.5,3,0.01)
p2 = randrange(18,22,0.1)
A1 = (p1+p2)*(133)/((1100)*(9.8))
