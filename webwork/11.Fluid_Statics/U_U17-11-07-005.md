## Question Section 

Bird bones have air pockets in them to reduce their weightâ€”this also gives them an average density significantly less than that of the bones of other animals. Suppose an ornithologist weighs a bird bone in air and in water and finds its mass is(mass,(g) and its apparent mass when submerged is(mass2,(g) (the bone is watertight).
a) What mass of water is displaced?
b) What is the volume of the bone?
c) What is its average density?
## A
What mass of water is displaced?
### Answer Section

and its apparent mass when submerged is(mass2,((the bone is watertight).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(40,50,0.1)
mass2 = randrange(2,8,0.01)

A1 = (mass-mass2)
A2 = (mass-mass2)
A3 = mass/A1
