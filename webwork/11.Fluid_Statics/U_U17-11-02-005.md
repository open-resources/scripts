## Question Section 

Suppose you have a coffee mug with a circular cross section and vertical sides (uniform radius). What is its inside radius if it holds(mass,(g) of coffee when filled to a depth of(depth,(cm)? Assume coffee has the same density as water.
## G
of coffee when filled to a depth of(depth,(cm)? Assume coffee has the same density as water.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(300,400,0.1)
depth = randrange(5,10,0.1)

A1 = ((mass)/((1)*(pi)*(depth)))**(1/2)
