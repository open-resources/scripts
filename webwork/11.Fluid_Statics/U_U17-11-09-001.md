## Question Section 

During forced exhalation, such as when blowing up a balloon, the diaphragm and chest muscles create a pressure of(pressure,(mm Hg) between the lungs and chest wall. What force in newtons does this pressure create on the(area,(cm^2) surface area of the diaphragm?
## G
between the lungs and chest wall. What force in newtons does this pressure create on the(area,(cm^2) surface area of the diaphragm?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(500,800,1)
pressure = randrange(40,80,0.1)

A1 = (pressure)*(133)*(area)*(1/10000)
