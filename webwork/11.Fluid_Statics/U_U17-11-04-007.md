## Question Section 

What pressure is exerted on the bottom of a(width,(m) wide by(length,(textm) long gas tank that can hold(mass,(kg) of gasoline by the weight of the gasoline in it when it is full?
## G
of gasoline by the weight of the gasoline in it when it is full?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(40,60,0.1)
length = randrange(0.7,1,0.01)
width = randrange(0.4,0.7,0.01)

A1 = (mass)*(9.8)/((length)*(width))
