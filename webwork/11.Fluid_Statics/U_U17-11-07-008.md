## Question Section 

In an immersion measurement of a woman's density, she is found to have a mass of(mass,(kg) in air and an apparent mass of(mass2,(kg) when completely submerged with lungs empty. 
a) What mass of water does she displace?
b) What is her volume?
c) Calculate her density.
d) If her lung capacity is(1.75,(L), Calculate her total density. Is she able to float without treading water with her lungs filled with air? The density of air is(1.29,(kgm^3).
<b>Hint:<b> (If her density is less than the density of water, she will float)  
(rho) <sub>Total<sub> =
Will she float? Enter 0 for Yes or 1 for No:

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(50,70,0.1)
mass2 = randrange(0.06,0.09,0.0001)

A1 = mass - mass2
A2 = A1/1000
A3 = mass/A2
A4 = (mass+(0.00175)*(1.29))/(A2+0.00175)
A5 = 0
