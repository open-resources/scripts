## Question Section 

A rectangular gasoline tank can hold(mass,(kg) of gasoline when full. What is the depth of the tank if it is(width,(m) wide by(length,(m) long? The density of gasoline is(0.680times 10^3,(kgm^3).
## G
of gasoline when full. What is the depth of the tank if it is(width,(m) wide by(length,(m) long? The density of gasoline is(0.680times 10^3,(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(40,60,0.1)
width = randrange(0.4,0.6,0.001)
length = randrange(0.7,1,0.001)

A1 = (mass)/((680)*(length)*(width))
