## Question Section 

You can chew through very tough objects with your incisors because they exert a large force on the small area of a pointed tooth. What pressure in pascals can you create by exerting a force of(force,(N) with your tooth on an area of(area,(mm^2)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(1,4,0.01)
force = randrange(300,700,1)

A1 = (force)*(1000)*(1000)/(area)
