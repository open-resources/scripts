## Question Section 

If the pressure in the spinal fluid is(10.0,(mm Hg):
a) What is the reading of the water manometer in(cm H)<sub>2<sub>(O)?
<sub>2<sub>(O) 
b) What is the reading if the person sits up, placing the top of the fluid(height,(cm) above the tap? The fluid density is(1.05,(gmL). The inital pressure is equal to(1330,(Nm^2).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
height = randrange(40,80,0.1)

A1 = (10)*(133)*(1/98.1) 
A2 = ((1330)+(1050)*(9.8)*(height/100))/98.1
