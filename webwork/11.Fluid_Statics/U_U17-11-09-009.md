## Question Section 

Calculate the maximum force in newtons exerted by the blood on an aneurysm, or ballooning, in a major artery, given the maximum blood pressure for this person is(pressure,(mm Hg) and the effective area of the aneurysm is(area,(cm^2). Note that this force is great enough to cause further enlargement and subsequently greater force on the ever-thinner vessel wall.
## G
and the effective area of the aneurysm is(area,(cm^2). Note that this force is great enough to cause further enlargement and subsequently greater force on the ever-thinner vessel wall.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(15,30,0.1)
pressure = randrange(130,170,1)

A1 = (pressure)*(133)*(area)/10000
