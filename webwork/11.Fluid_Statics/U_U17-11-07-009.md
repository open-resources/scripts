## Question Section 

Some fish have a density slightly less than that of water and must exert a force (swim) to stay submerged. What force must an(mass,(kg) grouper exert to stay submerged in salt water if its body density is(density,(kgm^3)? Salt water has a density of(1025,(kgm^3).
## G
grouper exert to stay submerged in salt water if its body density is(density,(kgm^3)? Salt water has a density of(1025,(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(70,90,0.1)
density = randrange(900,1100,1)

A1 = ((mass)/(density))*(9.8)*(1025)-((mass)*(9.8))
