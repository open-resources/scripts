## Question Section 

a) Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at the bottom of the Marianas Trench near the Philippines, given its depth is(11,(km) and assuming the density of sea water is(1025,(kgm^3) and is constant all the way down. There is(1,(atm) per(101300,(Nm^2).
b) Calculate the percent decrease in volume of sea water due to such a pressure, assuming its bulk modulus is(2.2times 10^9,(Nm^2) and is the same as water and is constant.
c) What would be the ratio of change in density to initial density?

## Answer Section

A1 = (11000)*(1025)*(9.8)/(101300)
A2 = ((11000)*(1025)*(9.8)/(2200000000))*100
A3 = (1)/((1)-(A2/100))
