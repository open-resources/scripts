## Question Section 

Heroes in movies hide beneath water and breathe through a hollow reed (villains never catch on to this trick). In practice, you cannot inhale in this manner if your lungs are more than(60.0,(cm) below the surface. What is the maximum negative gauge pressure you can create in your lungs on dry land, assuming you can achieve(-pressure,(cm) water pressure with your lungs(60.0,(cm) below the surface?
<sub>2<sub>(O)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(2,5,0.01)

A1 = -(pressure)-(60)
