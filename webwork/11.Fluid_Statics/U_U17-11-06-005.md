## Question Section 

Suppose you measure a standing person's blood pressure by placing the cuff on his leg(0.500,(m) below the heart. Calculate the pressure you would observe (in units of(mm Hg)) if the pressure at the heart were(P1)  over(P2)(mm Hg). Assume that there is no loss of pressure due to resistance in the circulatory system (a reasonable assumption, since major arteries are large). The density of blood is equal to(1050,(kgm^3).
 
over


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P1 = randrange(110,130,1)
P2 = randrange(70,90,1)
a1 = (0.5)*(1050)*(9.8)/133
A1 = P1 + a1 
A2 = P2 + a1
