## Question Section 

What is the ratio of heights to which ethyl alcohol and water are raised by capillary action in the same glass tube? The surface tension of ethyl alcohol is equal to(0.0223,(Nm), the density is equal to(790,(kgm^3) and the contact angle is equal to(0) degrees.
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

A1 = (0.0223)*(1000)/((0.0728)*(790))
