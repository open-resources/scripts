## Question Section 

Scurrilous con artists have been known to represent gold-plated tungsten ingots as pure gold and sell them to the greedy at prices much below gold value but deservedly far above the cost of tungsten. With what accuracy must you be able to measure the mass of such an ingot in and out of water to tell that it is almost pure tungsten rather than pure gold? The density of gold and tungsten out of water are respectively(19.32,(gcm^3) and(19.30,(gcm^3). The densities of gold and tungsten in water are respectively(18.32,(gcm^3) and(18.30,(gcm^3)
Out of water =
In water =


## Answer Section

A= (19.32-19.30)/19.32*100
B = (18.32-18.30)/18.32*100
