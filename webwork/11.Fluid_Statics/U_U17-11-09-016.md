## Question Section 

The hydraulic system of a backhoe is used to lift a load as shown above. 
(a) Calculate the force  the slave cylinder must exert to support the(400,(kg) load and the(150,(kg) brace and shovel. 
 (b) What is the pressure in the hydraulic fluid if the slave cylinder is(2.50(cm) in diameter?
(c) What force would you have to exert on a lever with a mechanical advantage of(5.00) acting on a master cylinder(0.800,(cm) in diameter to create this pressure?
