## Question Section 

The greatest ocean depths on the Earth are found in the Marianas Trench near the Philippines. Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at the bottom of this trench, given its depth is(11.0,(km) and assuming the density of seawater(1.025times 10^3,(kgm^3) is constant all the way down.


## Answer Section

A1 = (11000)*(1025)*(9.8)
