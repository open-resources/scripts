## Question Section 

<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A(m,kg) car pulls a boat on a trailer. 
(a) What total force resists the motion of the car, boat, and trailer, if the car exerts a(F,N) force on the road and produces an acceleration of(a,ms^2)? The mass of the boat plus trailer is(m2,kg). 
(b) What is the force in the hitch between the car and the trailer if(:80%) of the resisting forces are experienced by the boat and trailer?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(1050,1150,1)
F = randrange(1850,1950,1)
a = randrange(0.90,1.10,1)
m2 = randrange(650,750,1)
A1 = F - (m + m2)*(a)
A2 = (m2*a) + 0.8*A1
