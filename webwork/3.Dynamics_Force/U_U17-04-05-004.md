## Question Section 

Suppose a(m,kg) gymnast climbs a rope. 
(a) What is the tension in the rope if he climbs at a constant speed? 
(b) What is the tension in the rope if he accelerates upward at a rate of(v,ms^2)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= randrange(58.2,63.2,0.1)
v = randrange(1.3,1.6,0.05)
A1 = m*9.8
A2 = m*(9.8+v)
