## Question Section 

Two children pull a third child on a snow saucer sled exerting forces  and  as shown above. Find the acceleration of the(m,kg) sled-and-child system. Note that the direction of the frictional force is unspecified; it will be in the opposite direction of the sum of (F_1) and(F_2).
## G
sled-and-child system. Note that the direction of the frictional force is unspecified; it will be in the opposite direction of the sum of (F_1) and(F_2).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(46.0,51.0,0.5)
f1x = 10*cos(45*pi/180)
f1y = 10*sin(45*pi/180)
f2x = 8*cos(30*pi/180)
f2y= 8*sin(30*pi/180)
F1 = f1x + f2x
F2 = f1y - f2y
FT = sqrt((F1)**2 + (F2)**2)
FN = FT - 7.5
A1 = (FN)/(m)
