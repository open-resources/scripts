## Question Section 

Suppose two children push horizontally, but in exactly opposite directions, on a third child in a wagon. The first child exerts a force of(75.0,(N), the second a force of(90.0,N), friction is(d1,N), and the mass of the third child plus wagon is(w,kg).
(a) Calculate the acceleration. 
(b) What would the acceleration be if friction were(15.0,N)?
## A
Calculate the acceleration. 
### Answer Section
## B
What would the acceleration be if friction were(15.0,N)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d1 = randrange(10.0,12.0,1.0)
w = randrange(22.0,24.0,0.5)
A1 = (90 - 75 - d1)/(w)
A2= 0
