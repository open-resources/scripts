## Question Section 

The rocket sled is decelerated at a rate of(v,ms^2). What magnitude of force is necessary to produce this deceleration? Assume that the rockets are off. The mass of the system is(m,kg).
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= randrange(1900,2300,100)
v = randrange(194,204,1)
A1 = m*v
