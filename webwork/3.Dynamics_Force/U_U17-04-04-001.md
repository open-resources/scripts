## Question Section 

(a) What net external force is exerted on a(massSI,kg) artillery shell fired from a battleship if the shell is accelerated at(vtimes 10^4,ms^2)?
(b) What force is exerted on the ship by the artillery shell, taking the direction in which the shell was fired to be positive?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
massSI = randrange(1000,1500,50)
v = randrange(2.20,2.60,0.05)

A1 = (massSI)*(v)*(10**(4))
A2 = (-A1)
