## Question Section 

The wheels of a midsize car exert a force of(f,N) backward on the road to accelerate the car in the forward direction. If the force of friction including air resistance is(r,N) and the acceleration of the car is(a,ms^2), what is the mass of the car plus its occupants?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f = randrange(2000,2150,50)
r = randrange (200,300,50)
a= randrange (1.75,1.95,0.5)
P = (f - r)/(a)
