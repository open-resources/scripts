## Question Section 

A rocket sled accelerates at a rate of(accelerationSI,(ms^2). Its passenger has a mass of(massSI,(kg). 
(a) Calculate the horizontal component of the force the seat exerts against his body.
ans_rule(40)(N)
## A
Calculate the horizontal component of the force the seat exerts against his body.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

accelerationSI  = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,0.5))
massSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(75,80,0.5))

force_horizontalSI = (accelerationSI*massSI)
force_verticalSI = (g*massSI)
force_totalSI = sqrt(force_horizontalSI**2 + force_verticalSI**2)

rads = atan(force_verticalSI/force_horizontalSI)
degrees = rads*(180/pi)
