## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A(m,kg) fireworks shell is fired straight up from a mortar and reaches a height of(h,m). 
(a) Neglecting air resistance (a poor assumption, but we will make it for this example), calculate the shell's velocity when it leaves the mortar. 
(b) The mortar itself is a tube(d,m) long. Calculate the average acceleration of the shell in the tube as it goes from zero to the velocity found in (a). 
(c) What is the average force exerted on the shell in the mortar? Compute the ratio of this result to the shell's weight.
Force:
Ratio:ans_rule(40)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(2.25,2.75,0.01)
h = randrange(105,115,1)
A1 = sqrt(2*9.8*h)
d = randrange(0.440,0.460,0.001)
P1 = (A1)**2
A2 = P1/(2*d)
P2 = m*A2
w = m*9.8
A3 = P2/w
