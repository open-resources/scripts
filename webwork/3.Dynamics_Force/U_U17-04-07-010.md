## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> An elevator filled with passengers has a mass of(m,kg). 
(a) The elevator accelerates upward from rest at a rate of(a,ms^2) for(t,s). Calculate the tension in the cable supporting the elevator. 
(b) The elevator continues upward at constant velocity for(8.50,s). What is the tension in the cable during this time? 
(c) The elevator decelerates at a rate of(d,ms^2) for(t2,s). What is the tension in the cable during deceleration? 
(d) How high has the elevator moved above its original starting point?
(e) What is its final velocity?

from random import randrange
m = randrange(1650,1750,1)
t = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
a = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
F = (m)*(a+9.8)
F2 = (m)*9.8
d = randrange(0.550,0.650,0.001)
F3 = (m)*(9.8 - d)
t2 = randrange(2.50,3.50,0.01)
P1 = 0.5*(a)*((t)**2)
v1= (a)*(t)
P2 = v1*8.5
t3 = (t2)**2
P3 = (v1*t2) - (0.5*d*t3)
A4 = P1 + P2 + P3
A5 = v1 - (d*t2)
