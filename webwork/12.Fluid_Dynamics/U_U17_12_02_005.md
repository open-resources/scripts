## Question Section 

<b>
Every few years, winds in Boulder, Colorado, attain sustained speeds of(v2)(ms) when the jet stream descends during early spring. Approximately what is the force due to the Bernoulli effect on a roof having an area of(A)(m^2)? Typical air density in Boulder is(p)(kgm^3), and the corresponding atmospheric pressure is(pressuretimes 10^4)(Nm^2). (Bernoulli's principle assumes laminar flow; using the principle here produces only an approximate result, because there is significant turbulence).
ans_rule(40)(N)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P1 = randrange(10,17,1)
v2 = randrange(45,55,1)
A = randrange(200,340,1)
p = 1.14
pressure = 8.89
F = 1/2*A*p*(v2**2)
