## Question Section 

<b>
Hoover Dam on the Colorado River is the highest dam in the United States at(221)(m), with an output of(1300)(MW). The dam generates electricity with water taken from a depth of(h)(m) and an average flow rate of(Q)(m^3)(s). 
a) Calculate the power in this flow. 
ans_rule(40)(W)
## A
Calculate the power in this flow. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

p = 1000
g = 9.8
h = 150
Q = 650
power = p*g*h*Q
ratio = 955.5/680
