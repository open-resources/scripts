## Question Section 

<b>
A layer of oil(Lmm)(mm) thick is placed between two microscope slides. Researchers find that a force of(Fftimes 10^-4)(N) is required to glide one over the other at a speed of(vcm)(cms) when their contact area is(Acm)(cm^2). What is the oil's viscosity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lmm = randrange(1.09,1.99,0.01)
L = Lmm*(10**-3)
vcm = randrange(1,2,0.03)
v = vcm/100
Acm = randrange(5,8,1)
A = Acm*(10**-4)
Ff = randrange(5,6,0.01)
F = Ff*(10**-4)
n = (F*L)/(v*A)*1000
