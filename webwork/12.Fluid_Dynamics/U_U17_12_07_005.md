## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose hydrogen and oxygen are diffusing through air. A small amount of each is released simultaneously. How much time passes before the hydrogen is(1.00)(s) ahead of the oxygen? Such differences in arrival times are used as an analytical tool in gas chromatography.
ans_rule(40)(s)


## Answer Section

DO2 = 1.8*(10**-5)
DH2 = 6.4*(10**-5)
tH = DO2/(DH2-DO2)
