## Question Section 

<b>
You can smell perfume very shortly after opening the bottle. To show that it is not
reaching your nose by diffusion, calculate the average distance a perfume molecule
moves in one second in air, given its diffusion constant(D) to be(1.00times 10^-6)(m^2)(s).
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

D = 1*(10**-6)
t = 1
x = sqrt(D*t*2)
