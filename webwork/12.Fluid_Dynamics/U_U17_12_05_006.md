## Question Section 

<b>
At what flow rate might turbulence begin to develop in a water main with a(d)-(m) diameter? Assume the water is at(20 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(m^3)(s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.003)
r = d/2
n = 1.002*(10**-3)
NR = 2000
p = 1000
Q = (pi*r*n*NR)/(2*p)
