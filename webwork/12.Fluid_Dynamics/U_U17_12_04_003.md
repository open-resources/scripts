## Question Section 

<b>
A glucose solution being administered with an IV has a flow rate of(Q)(cm^3)(min). What will the new flow rate be if the glucose is replaced by whole blood having the same density but a viscosity(n) times that of the glucose? All other factors remain constant.
ans_rule(40)(cm^3)(min)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Q =randrange(3,5,1)
n = randrange(2,3,0.01)
Q1 = Q*(1/n)
