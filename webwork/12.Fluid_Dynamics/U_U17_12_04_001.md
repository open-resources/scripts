## Question Section 

<b>
a) Calculate the retarding force due to the viscosity of the air layer between a cart and a level air track given the following information—the air temperature is(20^circC), the cart is moving at(v)(ms), its surface area is(Aatimes 10^-2)(m^2), and the thickness of the air layer is(Latimes 10^-5)(m).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Aa = randrange(2.13,3.45,0.02)
A = Aa*(10**-2)
v = randrange(0.400,0.500,0.001)
La = randrange(5.75,7.75,0.01)
L = La*(10**-5)
g = 9.8
m = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.001)
n = 1.81*(10**-5)
F = n*((v*A)/L)
w = m*g
Fw = F/w
