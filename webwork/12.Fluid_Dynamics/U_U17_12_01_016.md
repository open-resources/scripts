## Question Section 

<b>
Unreasonable Results: A mountain stream is(w)(m) wide and averages(l)(m) in depth. During the spring runoff, the flow in the stream reaches(100,000)(m^3)(s). 
What is the average velocity of the stream under these conditions?
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
w = randrange(10,16,1)
l = randrange(2,4,1)
Q = 1*(10**5)
A = l*w
v = Q/A
