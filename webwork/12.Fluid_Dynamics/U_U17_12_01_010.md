## Question Section 

<b>
The flow rate of blood through a(radtimes 10^-6)(m) radius capillary is(Qatimes 10^-9)(cm^3)(s).
a) What is the speed of the blood flow? (This small speed allows time for diffusion of materials to and from the blood). 
ans_rule(40)(cms)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
rad = randrange(2.00,3.15,0.17)
r = (rad*(10**-4))**2
A = pi*r
Qa = randrange(3.75,5.75,0.1)
Q = Qa*(10**-9)
v = Q/A
totalflow = randrange(85,99,1)
capillaries = totalflow/Q
