## Question Section 

<b>
The arterioles (small arteries) leading to an organ, constrict in order to decrease flow to the organ. To shut down an organ, blood flow is reduced naturally to(percent)(%) of its original value. By what factor did the radii of the arterioles constrict? 
Penguins do this when they stand on ice to reduce the blood flow to their feet.
ans_rule(40)(r_1)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(1,3,1)
r2 = (percent/100)**(1/4)
