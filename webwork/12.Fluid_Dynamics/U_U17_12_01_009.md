## Question Section 

<b>
a) Estimate the time it would take to fill a private swimming pool with a capacity of(V)(L) using a garden hose delivering(Qa)(Lmin).
b) How long would it take to fill if you could divert a moderate size river, flowing at(Qbm)(m^3)(s), into it?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
V = randrange(80000,90000,125)
Qa = randrange(55,75,1)
Qbm = randrange(4500,5500,14)
Qb = Qbm*1000
ta = V/Qa
tb = V/Qb
