## Question Section 

<b>
A fire hose has an inside diameter of(dcmhose)(cm). Suppose such a hose carries a flow of(QLs)(Ls) starting at a gauge pressure of(1.62times 10^6Nm^2). The hose goes(h)(m) up a ladder to a nozzle having an inside diameter of(dcmnozzle)(cm). 
a) Calculate the Reynolds numbers for flow in the fire hose to show that the flow must be turbulent.
ans_rule(40) > 2000
## A
Calculate the Reynolds numbers for flow in the fire hose to show that the flow must be turbulent.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = 10.0
p = 1000
n = 1.002*(10**-3)
dcmhose = randrange(5.800,6.900,0.011)
rhose = (dcmhose/2)*(1/100)
Ahose = pi*(rhose**2)
dcmnozzle = randrange(2.00,3.00,0.021)
rnozzle = (dcmnozzle/2)*(1/100)
Anozzle = pi*(rnozzle**2)
QLs = 40.0
Q = QLs*10**-3
vhose = Q/Ahose
vnozzle = Q/Anozzle
NRhose = (2*p*vhose*rhose)/n
NRnozzle = (2*p*vnozzle*rnozzle)/n
