## Question Section 

<b>
Oxygen reaches the veinless cornea of the eye by diffusing through its tear layer, which is(xmm)(mm) thick. How long does it take the average oxygen molecule to do this?
ans_rule(40)(s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
xmm = randrange(0.4,0.5,0.004)
x = (xmm*(10**-3))**2
D = 1*(10**-9)
t = x/(2*D)
