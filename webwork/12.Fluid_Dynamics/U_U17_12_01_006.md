## Question Section 

<b>
A major artery with a cross-sectional area of(A1)(cm^2) branches into(arteries) smaller arteries, each with an average cross-sectional area of(A2)(cm^2). By what factor is the average velocity of the blood reduced when it passes into these branches?
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
arteries = randrange(15,19,1)
A1 = randrange(1,2,1)
A2 = randrange(0.200,0.500,0.018)
Q = A1/(arteries*A2)
