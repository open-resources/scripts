## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the temperature the entire sky would have to be in order to transfer energy
by radiation at(QtAWm^2)—about the rate at which the Sun radiates when it is directly overhead on a clear day. This value is the effective temperature of the sky, a kind of average that takes account of the fact that the Sun occupies only a small part
of the sky but is much hotter than the rest. Assume that the body receiving the energy
has a temperature of(T2C ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(K)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

e = 1
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
T2C = randrange(23,28,1)
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
QtA = randrange(1000,1100,1)
T1 = (T2-((-QtA)/(o*e)))**(1/4)
