## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you walk into a sauna that has an ambient temperature of(T1C ^circC).
a) Calculate the rate of heat transfer to you by radiation given your skin temperature is
(T2C ^circtextC), the emissivity of skin is(e), and the surface area of your body is(A)(m^2).
ans_rule(40)(W)
## A
Calculate the rate of heat transfer to you by radiation given your skin temperature is
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(1.32,1.65,0.01)
T1C = randrange(50,55,1)
T2C = randrange(35,38,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = 0.98
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
c = 3500
m = randrange(72,78,1)
P = abs(o*e*A*T)
Tt = abs((P/(m*c))*60)
