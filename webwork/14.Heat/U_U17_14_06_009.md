## Question Section 

<b>
A person inhales and exhales(VL)(L) of(T2 ^circC) air, evaporating(mgtimes 10^-2)(g) of water from the lungs and breathing passages with each breath. 
a) How much heat transfer occurs due to evaporation in each breath?
ans_rule(40)(J)

### Answer Section
## G
of water from the lungs and breathing passages with each breath.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

VL = randrange(2,3,0.01)
V = VL*(10**-3)
mg = randrange(3,5,1)
m = mg*(10**-5)
p = 1.29
T2 = randrange(35,37,1)
T1 = randrange(20,24,1)
T = T2-T1
c = 721
t = 60
Lv = 2430*(10**3)
N = randrange(17,19,1)
Q = m*Lv
Pb = (N*Q)/t
Qc = p*V*c*T
Pc = (N*Qc)/t
