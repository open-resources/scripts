## Question Section 

<b>
(a) Calculate the rate of heat conduction through a double-paned window that has a(A)(m^2) area and is made of two panes of(d1cm)-(cm)-thick glass separated by a(d2cm)-(cm) air gap. The inside surface temperature is(T2^circC), while that on the outside is(T1^circC). Ignore the increased heat transfer in the air gap due to convection.

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

d1cm = randrange(0.7,0.8,0.001)
d1 = d1cm/100
d2cm = randrange(1,2,1)
d2 = d2cm/100
d3cm = randrange(1.47,1.8,0.001)
d3 = d3cm/100
T2 = randrange(13,15,1)
T1 = randrange(-10,-8,1)
A = randrange(1.10,1.50,0.01)
k1 = 0.84
k2 = 0.023
a1 = k1/d1
a2 = k2/d2
T = T2-T1
Q2t = (a1*a2*A*T)/(2*a2+a1)
Qt = (k1*A*T)/d3
