## Question Section 

<b>
Unreasonable Results: A slightly deranged Arctic inventor surrounded by ice thinks it would be much less mechanically complex to cool a car engine by melting ice on it than by having a water-cooled system with a radiator, water pump, antifreeze, and so on. 
If(percentuneff)(%) of the energy in(VL)(L) of gasoline is converted into “waste heat” in a car engine, how many kilograms of(0^circC) ice could it melt? Take the heat of vaporization of gasoline to be(Lvgas)(MJkg)
ans_rule(40)(kg)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


## The values here have intentionally been changed from those given in the textbook.
uneff = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.70,0.80,0.01))
percentuneff = sprintf("%0.1f",uneff*100)
VL = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(4,4.15,0.01))
Vmcubed  = VL*0.001                 
pgas = 680
mgas = (pgas)*(Vmcubed)
Lvgas = 43.4
Lvgasc = (Lvgas)*10**6
Q = (uneff)*(Lvgasc)*(mgas)
Lf = 334*(10**3)
m = Q/Lf
