## Question Section 

<b>
How many grams of coffee must evaporate from(mc)(g) of coffee in a(mg)-(g) glass cup to cool the coffee from(T2 ^circC) to(T1 ^circC)? You may assume the coffee has the same thermal properties as water and that the average heat of vaporization is(Lv)(kJkg). (You may neglect the change in mass of the coffee as it cools, which will give you an answer that is slightly larger than correct.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mc = randrange(100,200,1)
cc = 4186
mg = randrange(310,350,1)
cg = 900
T2 = randrange(90,99,1)
T1 = randrange(40,49,1)
T = T2-T1
Lv = 2340
M = (T/Lv)*(((mg*10**-3)*cg)+((mc*10**-3)*cc))   #Don't bother converting Lv - you will 
                                                                                            #mulitply and divide by 1000 to find grams.
