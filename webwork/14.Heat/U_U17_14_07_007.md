## Question Section 

<b>
Thermography is a technique for measuring radiant heat and detecting variations in surface temperatures that may be medically, environmentally, or militarily meaningful.
a) What is the percent increase in the rate of heat transfer by radiation from a given area at a temperature of(TC ^circC) compared with that at(TaC ^circC), such as on a person's skin? 
ans_rule(40)(%)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

TC = randrange(34,36,1)
TbC = randrange(20,25,1)
TaC = randrange(30,33,1)
Tb = (TbC+273.15)
Ta = (TaC+273.15)
T = (TC+273.15)
percenta = (((T/Ta)**4)-1)*100
percentb = (((T/Tb)**4)-1)*100
