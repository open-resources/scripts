## Question Section 

<b>
What would be the final temperature if(0.260)(kg) of(T2 ^circC) water was placed in a(T1 ^circC),(mal)(kg) aluminum pan and(0.0100)(kg) of the water evaporated immediately, leaving the remainder to come to a common temperature with the pan?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)
## G
of(T2 ^circC) water was placed in a(T1 ^circC),(mal)(kaluminum pan and(0.0100)(kof the water evaporated immediately, leaving the remainder to come to a common temperature with the pan?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

mal = sprintf("%0.3f",0.5)
cal = 900
T1 = 150
al = mal*cal*T1
mw = 0.25
cw = 4186
T2 = 20
w = mw*cw*T2
mv = 0.01
Lv = 2256*(10**3)
mL = mv*Lv
num = al+w-mL
denom = (mw*cw)+(mal*cal)
Te = num/denom
