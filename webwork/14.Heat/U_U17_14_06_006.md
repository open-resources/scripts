## Question Section 

<b>
One winter day, the climate control system of a large university classroom building malfunctions. As a result,(V)(m^3) of excess cold air is brought in each minute. At what rate in kilowatts must heat transfer occur to warm this air by(T^circC) (that is, to bring the air to room temperature)?
ans_rule(40)(kW)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = randrange(500,550,1)
p = 1.29
T = randrange(10,15,1)
c = 721
t = 60
P = (p*V*c*T)/t
PkW = P*(1/1000)
