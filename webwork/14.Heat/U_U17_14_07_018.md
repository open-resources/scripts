## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: In certain large geographic regions, the underlying rock is hot. Wells can be drilled and water circulated through the rock for heat transfer for the generation of electricity. 
a) Calculate the heat transfer that can be extracted by cooling(1.00)(km^3) of granite by(T ^circC). 
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = (1*(10**3))**3
c = 840
T = randrange(100,114,1) 
p = 2700
Q = p*V*c*T
PMW = randrange(300,330,1)
P = PMW*(10**6)
t = (Q/P)*(1/3600)*(1/24)*(1/365.25)
