## Question Section 

<b>
The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii is the world's most active, disgorging about(Vatimes 10^5)(m^3) of(T2^circC) lava per day. What is the rate of heat transfer out of Earth by convection if this lava has a density of(p)(kgm^3) and eventually cools to(T1 ^circC)? Assume that the specific heat of lava is the same as that of granite.
ans_rule(40)(MW)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Va = randrange(5,5.5,0.01)
V = Va*(10**5)
p = 2700
T2 = randrange(1200,1250,1)
T1 = randrange(20,30,1)
T = T2-T1
c = 840
t = 86400
P = ((p*V*c*T)/t)*(1/1000000)
