## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Frozen waste from airplane toilets has sometimes been accidentally ejected at high altitude. Ordinarily it breaks up and disperses over a large area, but sometimes it holds together and strikes the ground. Calculate the mass of(0 ^circC) ice that can be melted by the conversion of kinetic and gravitational potential energy when a(M)(kg) piece of frozen waste is released at(hkm)(km) altitude while moving at(vi)(ms) and strikes the ground at(vf)(ms) (since less than(M)(kg) melts, a significant mess results).
ans_rule(40)(kg)
## G
piece of frozen waste is released at(hkm)(km) altitude while moving at(vi)(ms) and strikes the ground at(vf)(ms) (since less than(M)(kmelts, a significant mess results).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

M = randrange(20,25,1)
hkm = randrange(12,16,1)
h = (hkm*(10**3))
Lf = 334*(10**3)
g = 9.8
vi = randrange(230,250,1)
vf = randrange(100,130,1)
v = 0.5*((vi**2)-(vf**2))
m =(M*((g*h)+v))/Lf
