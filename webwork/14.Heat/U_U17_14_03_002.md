## Question Section 

<b>
A bag containing(0 ^circC) ice is much more effective in absorbing energy than one
containing the same amount of(0 ^circC) water. 
a) How much heat transfer is necessary to raise the temperature of(m)(kg) of water from(0 ^circC) to(T ^circC)? 
b) How much heat transfer is required to first melt(m)(kg) of(0 ^circC) ice and then raise its temperature?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(0.7,0.8,0.003)
c = 4186
T = randrange(30,34,1)
Qa = m*c*T
Lf = 334*(10**3)
Qb = (m*Lf)+Qa
