## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a person is covered head to foot by wool clothing with average thickness of
(dcm)(cm) and is transferring energy by conduction through the clothing at the rate of
(Qt)(W). What is the temperature difference across the clothing, given the surface
area is(A)(m^2)?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(2,5,1)
d = dcm/100
A = randrange(1.10,1.40,0.01)
k = 0.04
Qt = randrange(50,60,1)
T = (d*Qt)/(k*A)
