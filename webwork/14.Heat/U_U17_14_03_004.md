## Question Section 

<b>
The formation of condensation on a glass of ice water causes the ice to melt faster than it would otherwise. If(mw)(g) of condensation forms on a glass containing both water and(200)(g) of ice, how many grams of the ice will melt as a result? Assume no other heat transfer occurs.
ans_rule(40)(g)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mw = randrange(7,9,1)
Lv = 2430000
Lf = 334000
mice = mw*(Lv/Lf)
