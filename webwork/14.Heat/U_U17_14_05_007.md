## Question Section 

<b>
a) What is the rate of heat conduction through the(dcm)-(cm)-thick fur of a large animal having a(A)(m^2) surface area? Assume that the animal's skin temperature is(T2^circC), that the air temperature is(T1^circC), and that fur has the same thermal conductivity as air.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(2,5,1)
d = dcm/100
T2 = randrange(32,35,1)
T1 = randrange(-6,-3,1)
A = randrange(1.1,1.4,0.1)
k = 0.023
T = T2-T1
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
W = Qt*(8.64*(10**4))*(1/4186)
