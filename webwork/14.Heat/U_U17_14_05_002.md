## Question Section 

<b>
The rate of heat conduction out of a window on a winter day is rapid enough to chill the air next to it. To see just how rapidly the windows transfer heat by conduction, calculate the rate of conduction in watts through a(A)(m^2) window that is(dcm)(cm) thick if the temperatures of the inner and outer surfaces are(T2^circC) and(T1^circC) respectively. This rapid rate will not be maintained—the inner surface will cool, and even result in frost formation.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(0.630,0.637,0.001)
d = dcm/100
T2 = randrange(4,7,1)
T1 = randrange(-10,-8,1)
A = randrange(2,4,1)
k = 0.84
T = T2-T1
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
