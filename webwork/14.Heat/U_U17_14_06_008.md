## Question Section 

<b>
During heavy exercise, the body pumps(VL)(L) of blood per minute to the surface,
where it is cooled by(T ^circC). What is the rate of heat transfer from this forced
convection alone, assuming blood has the same specific heat as water and its density
is(p)(kgm^3)?
ans_rule(40)(W)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

VL = randrange(2,3,0.01)
V = VL*(10**-3)
p = 1050
T = randrange(2,4,1)
c = 4186
t = 60
P = ((p*V*c*T)/t)
