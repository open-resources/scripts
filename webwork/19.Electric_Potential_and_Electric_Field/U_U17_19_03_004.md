## Question Section 

a) How far from a(chargetimes10^-6)(C) point charge will the potential be(voltageASI)(V)?
b) At what distance will it be(voltageBSI)(V)?
## A
How far from a(chargetimes10^-6)(C) point charge will the potential be(voltageASI)(V)?
### Answer Section
## B
At what distance will it be(voltageBSI)(V)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
charge = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.90,1.10,0.01))
chargeSI = charge*10**-6
voltageASI = randrange(90,110,1)
voltageBSI = 2*voltageASI

radiusASI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(voltageASI)
radiusBSI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(voltageBSI)
