## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you want a capacitor bank with a total capacitance of(capacitanceTSI)(F) and you possess numerous(capacitancei)(mF) capacitors. What is the smallest number you could hook together to achieve your goal, connecting them in parallel?
ans_rule(40) capacitors


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitancei = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2.5,0.25))
capacitanceiSI = capacitancei*10**-3
capacitanceTSI = 0.5*capacitancei

number = (capacitanceTSI)/(capacitanceiSI)
