## Question Section 

<b>
How far apart are two conducting plates that have an electric field strength of(EFieldtimes 10^3)(Vm) between them, if their potential difference is(voltage)(kV)?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
EField = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(4,5,0.25))
EFieldSI = EField*1000
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(12.5,17.5,2.5))
voltageSI = voltage*1000

distanceSI = (voltageSI)/(EFieldSI)
