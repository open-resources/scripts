## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heatcapbody = 3500
voltageSI = randrange(400,500,10)
capacitance = randrange(50,200,5)
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6
mass = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.180,0.280,0.010))
massSI = mass*10**-3

deltatemp = (0.5*capacitanceSI*(voltageSI**2))/(massSI*heatcapbody)
