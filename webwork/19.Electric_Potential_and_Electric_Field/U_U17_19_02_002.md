## Question Section 

<b>
What is the strength of the electric field between two parallel conducting plates separated by(distance)(cm) and having a potential difference between them of(voltagetimes 10^4)(V)?
ans_rule(40)(Vm)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.5,0.8,0.01))
distancem = distance/100
voltage = randrange(1.25,1.75,0.25)
voltageV = voltage*10**4

EField = (voltageV)/(distancem)
