## Question Section 

A lightning bolt strikes a tree, moving(charge)(C) of charge through a potential difference of(voltagetimes 10^2)(MV).
a) What energy was dissipated?
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A
What energy was dissipated?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = randrange(20,30,1)
voltage = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.00,1.10,0.01))
temp1 = randrange(13,25,1)
tempboiling = 100
heatcap = 4186
heatvap = 2256000

deltatemp = tempboiling-temp1
energy = charge*(voltage*10**8)
masswater = energy/(heatcap*deltatemp+heatvap)
