## Question Section 

<b>
An evacuated tube uses an accelerating voltage of(V)(kV) to accelerate electrons to hit a copper plate and produce x rays. Non-relativistically, what would be the maximum speed of these electrons?
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
V = randrange(39,41,1)
E = (2*(1.6*10**-19)*(V*10**3)/(9.11*10**-31))**(1/2)
