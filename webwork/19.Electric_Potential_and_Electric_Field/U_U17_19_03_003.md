## Question Section 

<b>
A sphere has a surface uniformly charged with(chargeSI)(C). At what distance from its center is the potential(voltage)(MV)?
ans_rule(40)(km)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
chargeSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
voltage = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.75,5.25,0.25))
voltageSI = voltage*10**6

radiusSI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(voltageSI)
radiuskm = radiusSI/1000
