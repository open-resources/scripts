## Question Section 

<b>
What is the capacitance of a large Van de Graaff generator's terminal, given that it stores(charge)(mC) of charge at a voltage of(voltage)(MV)?
ans_rule(40)(pF)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7,8.5,0.01))
chargeSI = charge*10**-3
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1))
voltageSI = voltage*10**6

capacitanceSI = (chargeSI)/(voltageSI)
capacitancepF = capacitanceSI*10**12
