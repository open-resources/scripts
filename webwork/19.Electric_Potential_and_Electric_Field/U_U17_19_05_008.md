## Question Section 

<b>
Find the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor having plates of area(areaSI)(m^2) that are separated by(distance)(mm) of Teflon.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Kdielectric = 2.1
permittivity = 8.85*10**-12
areaSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,10,0.25))
distance = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.1,0.2,0.005))
distanceSI = distance*10**-3

capacitanceSI = ((Kdielectric*permittivity*areaSI)/(distanceSI))
capacitanceuF = capacitanceSI*10**6
