## Question Section 

<b>
Find the ratio of speeds of an electron and a negative hydrogen ion (one having an extra electron) accelerated through the same voltage, assuming non-relativistic final speeds. Take the mass of the hydrogen ion to be(masstimes 10^-27)(kg).
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

mass = 1.675
E = ((mass*10**(-27))/(9.11*10**(-31)))**(1/2)
