## A
What is the final speed of an electron accelerated from rest through a voltage of(voltage)(MV) by a negatively charged Van de Graaff terminal?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
voltage = randrange(20,30,1)
voltageSI = voltage*10**6
massSI = 9.11*10**-31
c = 3*10**8

velocitySI = sqrt((2*Qelem*voltageSI)/(massSI))

ratio = (velocitySI)/(c)
