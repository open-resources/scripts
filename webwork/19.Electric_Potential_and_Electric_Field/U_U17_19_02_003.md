## Question Section 

<b>
The electric field strength between two parallel conducting plates separated by(distanceT)(cm) is(EField)(times 10^4)(Vm).
a) What is the potential difference between the plates?
ans_rule(40)(kV)

What is the potential difference between the plates?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distanceT = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(5,9,0.1))
distanceTSI = distanceT/100
EField = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(7,10,0.5))
EFieldSI = EField*10**4

voltageTSI = (EFieldSI)*(distanceTSI)
voltageTkV = voltageTSI/1000

distanceb = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(1,2,0.1))
distancebSI = distanceb/100
voltagebSI = (distancebSI)*(EFieldSI)
