## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> The temperature near the center of the Sun is thought to be 15 million degrees Celsius. Through what voltage must a singly charged ion be accelerated to have the same energy as the average kinetic energy of ions at this temperature?
ans_rule(40)(V)


## Answer Section

charge = 1.6*10**-19
Kb = 1.38*10**-23
temp = 1.5*10**7
tempK = temp+273.15

voltage = (3*Kb*tempK)/(2*charge)
