## Question Section 

<b>
Find the charge stored when(voltageSI)(V) is applied to an(capacitancepF)(pF) capacitor.
ans_rule(40)(pC)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,10,0.25))
capacitancepF = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,10,0.25))

chargepC = (voltageSI)*(capacitancepF)
