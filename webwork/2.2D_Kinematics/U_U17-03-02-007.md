## Question Section 

Suppose you first walk(a) m in a direction(20) degrees east of north and then(b) m in a direction(40) degrees north of west. How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?
a) How far are you from your starting point,
ans_rule(40) m
## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(10,40,0.1)
b = randrange(10,40,0.1)

a1 = ((a)*(sin(20*pi/180)))-((b)*(cos(40*pi/180)))
a2 = ((a)*(cos(20*pi/180)))+((b)*(sin(40*pi/180)))
A1 = sqrt(((a1)**(2))+((a2)**(2)))
A2 = atan(a1/a2)*(180/pi)
