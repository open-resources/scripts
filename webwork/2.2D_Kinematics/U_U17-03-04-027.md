## Question Section 

In 2007, Michael Carter (U.S.) set a world record in the shot put with a throw of(24.77,(m).
What was the initial speed of the shot if he released it at a height of(2.10,(m) and threw it at an angle of(38.0^circ) above the horizontal?
(Although the maximum distance for a projectile on level ground is achieved at  when air resistance is neglected, the actual angle to achieve maximum range is smaller; thus, will give a longer range than  in the shot put.)
## C
above the horizontal?
