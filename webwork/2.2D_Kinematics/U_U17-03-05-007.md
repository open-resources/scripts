## Question Section 

A jet airplane flying from Darwin, Australia, has an air speed of(as,ms) in a direction(sw^circ) south of west. It is in the jet stream, which is blowing at(js,ms) in a direction (b^circ) south of east. What is the velocity of the airplane relative to the Earth?
## C
south of west. It is in the jet stream, which is blowing at(js,ms) in a direction (b^cirsouth of east. What is the velocity of the airplane relative to the Earth?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a= randrange(183,186,1)
sw = a-180
as = randrange(255,265,1)
js = randrange(33,37,1)
b = randrange(13,17,1)
rad1 = a*pi/180
rad2 = b*pi/180
x = as*cos(rad1)+js*cos(rad2)
y = as*sin(rad1)+js*sin(-rad2)
p1 = (x)**2
p2 = (y)**2
z = sqrt(p1+p2)
t = atan(y/x)*180/pi
