## Question Section 

In an attempt to escape his island, Gilligan builds a raft and sets to sea. The wind shifts a great deal during the day, and he is blown along the following straight lines:
(2.50,km,,45.0^circ) north of west; then(4.70,km,,60.0^circ) south of east; then(1.30,km,,25.0^circ) south of west; then(5.10,km,) east; then(1.70,km,,5.00^circ) east of north; then(7.2,km,,55.0^circ) south of west; then(2.80,km,,10.0^circ) north of east. What is his final position relative to his starting point?

## Answer Section

X = -2.5*cos(pi/4)+4.7*cos(pi/3)-1.3*cos(pi/7.2)+5.1+1.7*sin(pi/36)-7.2*cos(55*pi/180)+2.8*cos(pi/18)
Y = 2.5*sin(pi/4)-4.7*sin(pi/3)-1.3*sin(pi/7.2)+1.7*cos(pi/36)-7.2*sin(55*pi/180)+2.8*sin(pi/18)
C= (X)**2+(Y)**2
A1 = sqrt(C)
A2 = 180-atan(-X/Y)*180/pi
