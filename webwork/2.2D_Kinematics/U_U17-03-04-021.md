## Question Section 

Gun sights are adjusted to aim high to compensate for the effect of gravity, effectively making the gun accurate only for a specific range.
If a gun is sighted to hit targets that are at the same height as the gun and(100.0,(m) away, how low will the bullet hit if aimed directly at a target(d.0,(m) away? The muzzle velocity of the bullet is(v,(ms).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(145,155,1)
v = randrange(269,276,1)
t = 0.5*asin(980/(v)**2)

A1= -(d*tan(t)-4.9*(d/(v*cos(t)))**2)
