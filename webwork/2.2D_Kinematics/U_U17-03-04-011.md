## Question Section 

An archer shoots an arrow at a(d,m) distant target; the bull's-eye of the target is at same height as the release height of the arrow.
a) At what angle must the arrow be released to hit the bull's-eye if its initial speed is(v,ms)?
 
b) There is a large tree halfway between the archer and the target with an overhanging horizontal branch(3.50,m) above the release height of the arrow. Will the arrow go over or under the branch?
Enter "over" or "under"

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(73,76,1)
v = randrange(34,36,0.2)
s = (v)**2
p1= 0.5*arcsin(9.8*d/s)*180/pi
