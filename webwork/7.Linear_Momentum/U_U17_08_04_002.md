## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Two manned satellites approach one another at a relative speed of(v,ms), intending to dock. The first has a mass of(m1times 10^3,kg), and the second a mass of(m2times 10^3,kg). If the two satellites collide elastically rather than dock,
what is their final relative velocity?
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.5,4.75,0.05))
m2 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.5,7.75,0.05))

v = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.2,0.25,0.005))
