## Question Section 

<b>
a) During an ice skating performance, an initially motionless(m1-kg) clown throws a fake barbell away. The clown's ice skates allow her to recoil frictionlessly. If the clown recoils with a velocity of(v1,ms) and the barbell is thrown with a velocity of(v2,ms) what is the mass of the barbell? 
b) How much kinetic energy is gained by this maneuver?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(80,82.5,0.5))
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,15,1))
v1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.5,0.525,0.005))

m2 = (m1*v1)/v2
KE = 0.5*((m1*(v1**2))+(m2*(v2**2)))
