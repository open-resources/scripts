## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> The Moon's craters are remnants of meteorite collisions. Suppose a fairly large asteroid that has a mass of(maitimes 10^12,kg) (about a kilometer across) strikes the Moon at a speed of (vakm,kms). 
a) At what speed does the Moon recoil after the perfectly inelastic collision, given that the mass of the Moon is(7.36times 10^22,kg)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vakm = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,17.5,0.5))
va = vakm*(10**3)
mai = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,5.25,0.05))
ma = mai*(10**12)
mm = 7.36*(10**22)

vm = (ma*va)/(mm+ma)
KEi = 0.5*ma*(va**2)
KEf = 0.5*(ma+mm)*(vm**2)
KE = abs(KEf-KEi)
