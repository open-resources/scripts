## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vo = randrange(20,30,1)
m = randrange(70,80,1)
xacm = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.25,0.05))
xa = xacm/100
xbcm = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14,14.5,0.1))
xb = xbcm/100
v = 0
aa = (v-(vo**2))/(2*xa)
ab = (v-(vo**2))/(2*xb)

Fa = m*aa
Fb = m*ab
