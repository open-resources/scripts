## Question Section 

<b>
Two identical pucks collide on an air hockey table. One puck was originally at rest. 
If the incoming puck has a speed of(v1,ms) and scatters to an angle of(phi ^circ), what is the magnitude of the velocity of the second puck? (You may use the result that(theta _1 -theta _2 = 90^circ) for elastic collisions of objects that have identical masses.) 
ans_rule(40)(ms)
## C
for elastic collisions of objects that have identical masses.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

phi = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(27.5,30,0.5))
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,8.25,0.05))

v22 = v1*sin(phi*pi/180)
