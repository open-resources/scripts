## Question Section 

<b>
A cruise ship with a mass of(matimes 10^7,kg) strikes a pier at a speed of(vo,ms). It comes to rest(x,m) later, damaging the ship, the pier, and the tugboat captain's finances. Calculate the average force exerted on the pier using the concept of impulse.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

ma = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
m = ma*(10**7)
vo = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1,0.05))
x = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,6,1))
t = (2*x)/vo
vf = -(m*(0-vo))/t
