## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Ion-propulsion rockets have been proposed for use in space. They employ atomic ionization techniques and nuclear energy sources to produce extremely high exhaust velocities, perhaps as great as(vatimes 10^6,ms). These techniques allow a much more favorable payload-to-fuel ratio. To illustrate this fact:
a) Calculate the increase in velocity of a(mo-kg) space probe that expels only(m1-kg) of its mass at the given exhaust velocity.
ans_rule(40)(ms)
## A
Calculate the increase in velocity of a(mo-kg) space probe that expels only(m1-kg) of its mass at the given exhaust velocity.
### Answer Section
## G
space probe that expels only(m1-kof its mass at the given exhaust velocity.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mo = randrange(20000,20250,50)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,8.25,0.05))
v = va*(10**6)
m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,75,25))
m = mo-m1
mta = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.25,4.5,0.05))
mt = mta*(10**-6)

v1 = v*ln(mo/m)
a = (v/mo)*mt
