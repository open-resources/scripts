## Question Section 

 
  
A tennis ball has mass(58) grams and a bowling ball has a mass of(4.8) kg. The two balls have the same kinetic energy. Let(p_1) represent the momentum of the tennis ball and let(p_2) represent the momentum of the bowling ball. Determine the ratio(fracp_2p_1) of the momenta of the two balls.  
(fracp_2p_1) = ans_rule(20)
