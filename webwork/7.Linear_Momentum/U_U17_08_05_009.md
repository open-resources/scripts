## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> One of the waste products of a nuclear reactor is plutonium-239,(^239Pu). This nucleus is radioactive and decays by splitting into a helium-4 nucleus,(^4He), and a uranium-235 nucleus,(^235U), the latter of which is also radioactive and will itself decay some time later. The energy emitted in the plutonium decay is(8.40times 10^-13,J) and is entirely converted to kinetic energy of the helium and uranium nuclei. The mass of the helium nucleus is(6.68times 10^-27,kg), while that of the uranium is(3.92times 10^-25,kg) (note that the ratio of the masses is 4 to 235).
 
a) Calculate the speed of the helium nucleus, assuming the plutonium nucleus is originally at rest.

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

KE = 2*(8.4*(10**-13))
mHe = 6.68*(10**-27)
mU = 3.92*(10**-25)
vHe = (KE/(((mHe**2)/mU)+mHe))**(1/2)
vU = (mHe*vHe)/mU

KEHe = 0.5*mHe*(vHe**2)
KEHec = KEHe*10**13
KEU = 0.5*mU*(vU**2)
KEUd = KEU*10**14
