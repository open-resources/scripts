## Question Section 

<b>
When serving a tennis ball, a player hits the ball when its velocity is zero (at the
highest point of a vertical toss). The racquet exerts a force of(F,N) on the ball for(tms,ms), giving it a final velocity of(v,ms). Using these data, find the mass of the ball.
ans_rule(40)(kg)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

tms = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,9,1))
t = tms/1000
v = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,1))
F = randrange(550,575,5)
m = (F*t)/v
