## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass_canSI = sprintf("%0.2f", sprintf(8,8.5,0.05))
mass_truck = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.25,1.75,0.05))
mass_truckSI = (mass_truck)*10**4

velocity_truckSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,15,0.5))

momentum_truckSI = (mass_truckSI)*(velocity_truckSI)

velocity_canSI = (momentum_truckSI)/(mass_canSI)
