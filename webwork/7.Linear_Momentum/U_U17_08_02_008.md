## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Military rifles have a mechanism for reducing the recoil
forces of the gun on the person firing it. An internal part recoils over a relatively large
distance and is stopped by damping mechanisms in the gun. The larger distance
reduces the average force needed to stop the internal part. 
a) Calculate the recoil velocity of a(m1-kg) plunger that directly interacts with a(m2-kg) bullet fired at(v2l,ms) from the gun. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)
## A
Calculate the recoil velocity of a(m1-kg) plunger that directly interacts with a(m2-kg) bullet fired at(v2l,ms) from the gun. 
### Answer Section

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m2 = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.02,0.025,0.0005))
v2l = randrange(625,650,5)
m1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
v1l = -(m2*v2l)/m1
xcm = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,22.5,0.5))
x = xcm/100
acceleration = (0-(v1l**2))/(2*x)
Fb = m1*acceleration
tms = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(17.5,20,0.5))
t = tms/1000
Fc = -(m2*v2l)/t

ratio = Fb/Fc
