## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vi = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(3,3.5,0.5))
vf = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(2,2.5,0.5))
m = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.25,0.275,0.005))
t = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.015, 0.025, 0.01))

F = (m*(-vf-vi))/t
KE = 0.5*m*(vi**2-vf**2)
KEleft = (vf/vi)**2*100
