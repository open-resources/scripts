## Question Section 

<b>
A(m2-kg) bullet is accelerated from rest to a speed of(v2,ms) in a(m1-kg) rifle. The pain of the rifle's kick is much worse if you hold the gun loosely a few centimetres from your shoulder rather than holding it tightly against your shoulder. 
a) Calculate the recoil velocity of the rifle if it is held loosely away from the shoulder. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.25,0.05))
m2 = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.025,0.03,0.0005))
m1c = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(27.5,30,0.5))
v2 = randrange(550,575,25)

v1 = -(m2*v2)/m1
KE = 0.5*m1*(v1**2)
v1c = -(m2*v2)/m1c
KE2 = 0.5*m1c*(v1c**2)
