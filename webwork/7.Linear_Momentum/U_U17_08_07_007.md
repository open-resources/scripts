## Question Section 

<b>
A fire extinguisher-toy wagon starts from rest and attains a final velocity of(v,ms). The total mass is initially(mo,kg) and is(m,kg) after the extinguisher is fired. Calculate the average exhaust velocity of the gases expelled from the extinguisher.
ans_rule(40)(ms)
## G
and is(m,kafter the extinguisher is fired. Calculate the average exhaust velocity of the gases expelled from the extinguisher.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mo = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(77.5,80,0.5))
m = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(67.5,70,0.5))
v = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,12.5,0.5))

ve = v/(ln(mo/m))
