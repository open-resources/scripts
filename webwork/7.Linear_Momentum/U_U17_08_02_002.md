## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> A car moving at(v,ms) crashes into a tree and stops in(t,s). Calculate the magnitude of the force the seat belt exerts on a passenger in the car to bring him to a halt. The mass of the passenger is(m,kg).
ans_rule(40)(N)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(70,80,2)
v = randrange(10,15,1)
t = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.2,0.3,0.01))
F = (m*v)/t
