## Question Section 

<b>
What is the velocity of a(m1-kg) car initially moving at(v1,ms), just after it hits a(m2-kg) deer initially running at(v2,ms) in the same direction? Assume the deer remains on the car.
ans_rule(40)(ms)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.5))
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,15,0.5))
m1 = randrange(900,950,25)
m2 = randrange(100,150,25)

v = ((m1*v1)+(m2*v2))/(m1+m2)
