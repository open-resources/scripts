## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Squids have been reported to jump from the ocean and travel(R,m) (measured horizontally) before re-entering the water. 
a) Calculate the initial speed of the squid if it leaves the water at an angle of(theta ^circ), assuming negligible lift from the air and negligible air resistance. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)
## A
Calculate the initial speed of the squid if it leaves the water at an angle of(theta ^circ), assuming negligible lift from the air and negligible air resistance.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

R = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(32.5,35,0.5))
theta = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,25,1))
g = 9.8
ve = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12.5,15,0.5))

v = ((g*R)/(sin(2*theta*(pi/180))))**(1/2)
ejected = 1-(exp(-v/ve))
