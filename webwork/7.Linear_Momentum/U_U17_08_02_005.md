## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Suppose a child drives a bumper car head on into the siderail, which exerts a force of(F,N) on the car for(t,s).

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

F = randrange(4000,4200,1)
m = randrange(200,210,1)
t = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.2,0.25,0.05))
vib = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.60,2.85,0.05))

p = -F*t
vf = (p+(m*vib))/m
