## Question Section 

<b>
How much of a single-stage rocket that is(moitimes 10^5,kg) can be anything but fuel if the rocket is to have a final speed of(vkm,kms), given that it expels gases at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms)?
ans_rule(40)(kg)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

moi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
mo = moi*(10**5)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.25,2.5,0.05))
ve = va*(10**3)
vkm = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,8.25,0.05))
v = vkm*(10**3)

m = mo*(exp(-v/ve))
