from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(95,115,5)
m2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.42,0.425,0.005))
v1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(8,12,1))
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(22.5,25,0.5))
v2c = -v2

v = ((m1*v1)+(m2*v2))/(m1+m2)
KE = abs(-((1/2)*((m1*(v1**2))+(m2*(v2**2))))+((1/2)*(m1+m2)*(v**2)))
vc = ((m1*v1)+(m2*v2c))/(m1+m2)
