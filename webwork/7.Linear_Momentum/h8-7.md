## Question Section 

 
  
A truck of mass 1800 kg travelling east at 45 kmh collides with a car of mass 1200 kg going north at 60 kmh in a completely inelastic collision (i.e. they stick together). Determine the velocity of the cartruck combination immediately after the collision.  
speed = ans_rule(20) kmh  
angle = ans_rule(20) degrees north of east
