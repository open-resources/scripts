## Question Section 

<b>
A(m1-kg) cannon is mounted so that it can recoil only in the horizontal direction. 
a) Calculate its recoil velocity when it fires a(m2-kg) shell at(v2,ms) at an angle of(theta2 ^circ) above the horizontal. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(3000,3250,50)
m2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,17.5,0.5))
v2 = randrange(450,550,25)
theta2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,22.5,0.5))

v1 = -(m2*v2*cos(theta2*(pi/180)))/m1
KE = 0.5*m1*(v1**2)
