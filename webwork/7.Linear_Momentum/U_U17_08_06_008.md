## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A(mh-kg) ice hockey player hits a(mp-kg) puck, giving the puck a velocity of(vp,ms). If both are initially at rest and if the ice is frictionless, how far backwards does the player recoil in the time it takes the puck to reach the goal(dp,m) away?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mh = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,92.5,0.5))
mp = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.125,0.150,0.005))
vp = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(42.5,45,0.5))
vh = (mp*vp)/mh
dp = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12.5,15,0.5))

tp = dp/vp
dh = vh*tp*100
