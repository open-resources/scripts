## A
What is the wavelength of such a neutron? Take the mass of a neutron to be(1.675times 10^-27,kg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.675*10**-27
velocitySI= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))

wavelengthSI = (h)/(massSI*velocitySI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**9
energySI = 0.5*(massSI*(velocitySI**2))
energy = (energySI/e)
