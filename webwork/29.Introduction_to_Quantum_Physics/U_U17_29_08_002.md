## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> An electron microscope produces electrons with a(wavelength,pm) wavelength. If these are passed through a(separation,nm) single slit, at what angle will the first diffraction minimum be found?
ans_rule(40) &#176;


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)

separation = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
separationSI = separation*10**-9
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-12

rads = asin(wavelengthSI/separationSI)
angle = rads*(180/pi)
