## Question Section 

<b>
How many photons per second are emitted by the antenna of a microwave oven, if its power output is(power,kW) at a frequency of(frequency,MHz)?
ans_rule(40)(fracphotonss)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

frequency = randrange(2500,2600,10)
frequencySI = frequency*10**6
power = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
powerSI = power*10**3

n = (powerSI)/(h*frequencySI)
