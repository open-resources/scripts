## Question Section 

<b>
The kinetic energy of an electron accelerated in an x-ray tube is(energy,keV). Assuming it is nonrelativistic, what is its wavelength? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(pm)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,100,0.5))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**3
massSI = 9.11*10**-31

wavelengthSI = (h)*(2*massSI*energySI)**(-1/2)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**12
