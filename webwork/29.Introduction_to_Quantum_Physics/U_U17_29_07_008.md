## Question Section 

<b>
The decay energy of a short-lived nuclear excited state has an uncertainty of(Uenergy,eV) due to its short lifetime. What is the smallest lifetime it can have?
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-16,s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

Uenergy= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
UenergySI = (Uenergy*e)

UtimeSI = (hbar/2)/(UenergySI)
Utime = UtimeSI*10**16
