## Question Section 

<b>
The lifetime of a highly unstable nucleus is(Utimetimes 10^-20,s). What is the smallest uncertainty in its decay energy?
ans_rule(40)(MeV)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

Utime = randrange(1,6,1)
UtimeSI = Utime*10**-20

UenergySI = (hbar/2)/(UtimeSI)
Uenergy = (UenergySI/e)*10**-6
