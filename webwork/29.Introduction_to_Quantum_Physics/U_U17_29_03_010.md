## Question Section 

<b>
What is the accelerating voltage of an x-ray tube that produces x-rays with a shortest wavelength of(wavelength,nm)?
ans_rule(40)(kV)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

wavelength = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.0090,0.0110,0.0005))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

voltageSI = (h*c)/(e*wavelengthSI)
voltage = voltageSI*10**-3
