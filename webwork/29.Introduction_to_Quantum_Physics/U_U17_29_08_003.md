What is the average photon energy in joules?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

delta_tempSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(1,6,0.5))
massSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,10,0.5))
heat_capacity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))
heat_capacitySI = 4186*heat_capacity
powerSI = randrange(175,225,5)
wavelength = randrange(1550,1650,10)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energy_per_photonSI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI)
energy_per_photon = energy_per_photonSI*10**19
energySI = (massSI*heat_capacitySI*delta_tempSI)
n = (energySI/energy_per_photonSI)
timeSI = (energySI/powerSI)
