### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
h = 6.63*10**-34

frequency = randrange(600,700,10)
frequencySI = frequency*10**3
power = randrange(45,55,1)
powerSI = power*10**3
radius = randrange(80,120,5)
radiusSI = radius*10**3

n = (powerSI)/(h*frequencySI)
flux_per_secondSI = (n)/(4*pi*radiusSI**2)
