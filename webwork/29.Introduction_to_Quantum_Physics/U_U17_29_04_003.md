### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

momentum = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.75,5.25,0.05))
momentumSI = momentum*10**-29

wavelengthSI = (h/momentumSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**6

energySI = (momentumSI*c)
energy = (energySI/e)
