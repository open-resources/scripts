## A
What is the photon momentum?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = (h)/(2*pi)

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-15

momentumSI = (h)/(wavelengthSI)
momentum = momentumSI*10**19
energySI = (momentumSI*c)
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-9
velocitySI = (c)*(1 - 0.5*(massSI*c/momentumSI)**2)
gamma = (1 - (velocitySI/c)**2)**(-1/2)
kinetic_energySI = (gamma - 1)*(massSI)*(c)**2
