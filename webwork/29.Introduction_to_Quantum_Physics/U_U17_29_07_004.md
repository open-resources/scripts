## Question Section 

<b>
The velocity of a proton in an accelerator is known to an accuracy of(percent%) of the speed of light. (This could be small compared with its velocity.) What is the smallest possible uncertainty in its position? Take the mass of a proton to be(1.673times 10^-27,kg).
ans_rule(40)(fm)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

massSI = 1.673*10**-27
percent = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.25,0.75,0.05))
ratio = percent*10**-2

UpositionSI = (hbar/2)/(massSI*ratio*c)
Uposition = UpositionSI*10**15
