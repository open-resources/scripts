## Question Section 

<b>
 
Assuming that(percent%) of a(powerSI,-W) light bulb's energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an average wavelength of(wavelength,nm), and that the photons spread out uniformly and are not absorbed by the atmosphere, how far away would you be if(n_eye) photons per second enter the(diameter_eye,-mm) diameter pupil of your eye? (This number easily stimulates the retina.)
ans_rule(40)(km)
## E
photons per second enter the(diameter_eye,-mm) diameter pupil of your eye? (This number easily stimulates the retina.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
ratio = percent*10**-2

diameter_eye = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.75,3.25,0.05))
radius_eyeSI = 0.5*(diameter_eye)*10**-3

n_eye = randrange(400,450,5)
powerSI = randrange(75,125,5)
wavelength = randrange(575,625,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

radius_bulbSI = (radius_eyeSI/2)*sqrt((powerSI*ratio*wavelengthSI)/(h*c*n_eye))
radius_bulb = radius_bulbSI*10**-3
