## Question Section 

<b>
Find the wavelength of photons that eject(energy,-eV) electrons from potassium, given that the binding energy is(phi,eV).
ans_rule(40)(nm)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.075,0.125,0.005))
energySI = (energy*e)
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.25,0.05))
phiSI  = (phi*e)

wavelengthSI = (h*c)/(energySI + phiSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**9
