## Question Section 

<b>
Violet light of wavelength(wavelength,nm) ejects electrons with a maximum kinetic energy of(energy,eV) from sodium metal. What is the binding energy of electrons to sodium metal?
ans_rule(40)(eV)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy= sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.75,1,0.025))
energySI = (energy*e)
wavelength = randrange(375,425,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

phiSI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - energySI
phi = (phiSI/e)
