## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> Sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere has an intensity of(intensity,kWm^2). If this is reflected straight back from a mirror that has only a small recoil.
a) Calculate the force per square meter of mirror.
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)
## A
Calculate the force per square meter of mirror.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = (h)/(2*pi)

intensity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
intensitySI = intensity*10**3
mass_per_areaSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.075,0.125,0.005))
time = randrange(20,30,1)
timeSI = 3600*time

pressureSI = (2*intensitySI)/(c)
accelerationSI = (pressureSI/mass_per_areaSI)
velocitySI = (accelerationSI*timeSI)
