## A
Calculate the wavelength of a photon that has the same momentum as a proton moving at(percent%) of the speed of light. Take the mass of a proton to be(1.673times 10^-27,kg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.673*10**-27
percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
ratio = percent*10**-2

momentumSI = (ratio*massSI*c)

wavelengthSI = (h/momentumSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**13
energy_photonSI = (momentumSI*c)
energy_photon = (energy_photonSI/e)*10**-6
energy_protonSI = 0.5*(massSI*(ratio*c)**2)
energy_proton = (energy_protonSI/e)*10**-6
