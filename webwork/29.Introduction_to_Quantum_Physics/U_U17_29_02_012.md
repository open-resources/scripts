## Question Section 

<b>
Photoelectrons from a material with a binding energy of(phi,eV) are ejected by(wavelength,-nm) photons. Once ejected, how long does it take these electrons to travel(distance,cm) to a detection device? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(s)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,10,0.5))
distanceSI = distance*10**-2
massSI = 9.11*10**-31
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)
wavelength = randrange(400,450,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energySI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - phiSI
velocitySI = sqrt(2*energySI/massSI)

timeSI = (distanceSI/velocitySI)
