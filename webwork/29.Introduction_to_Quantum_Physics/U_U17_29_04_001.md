## Question Section 

<b>
Find the momentum of a(wavelength,-cm) wavelength microwave photon.
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-32,kgcdotms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,10,0.5))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-2

momentumSI = (h/wavelengthSI)
momentum = momentumSI*10**32
