## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy_b = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(0.5,1,0.1))
energy_bSI = (energy_b*e)
frequency = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(1.5,2,0.1))
frequencySI = frequency*10**13

delta_energy_aSI = (frequencySI*h)
delta_energy_a = (delta_energy_aSI/e)
n_unrounded = (energy_bSI)/(frequencySI*h)-(1/2)
n = sprintf("%0.0f", n_unrounded)
