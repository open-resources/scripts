## Question Section 

<b>
What is the wavelength of an electron moving at(percent%) of the speed of light? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-11,m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.75,3.25,0.05))
ratio = percent*10**-2

wavelengthSI = (h)/(massSI*ratio*c)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**11
