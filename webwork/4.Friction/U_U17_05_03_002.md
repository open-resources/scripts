<b>
During a wrestling match, a(m)(kg) wrestler briefly stands on one hand during a
maneuver designed to perplex his already struggling adversary. By how much does
the upper arm bone shorten in length? The bone can be represented by a uniform rod
(Locm)(cm) in length and(rcm)(cm) in radius.

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Locm = randrange(45.00,60.00,2.3)
Lo = Locm/100
rcm = randrange(2.10,8.99,0.09)
r = rcm/100
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
m = randrange(98.00,130.00,3.00)
g = 9.80
F = m*g
Y = 9*(10**9)
L = (1/Y)*(F/A)*(Lo)
