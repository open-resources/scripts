## Question Section 

<b>
When water freezes, its volume increases by(percent)(%) (that is,(Î”VV_circ) =(VVo)). What force per unit area is water capable of exerting on a container when it freezes? (It is acceptable to use the bulk modulus of water in this problem).
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)
## C
=(VVo)). What force per unit area is water capable of exerting on a container when it freezes? (It is acceptable to use the bulk modulus of water in this problem).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(7.01,9.69,0.04)
VVo = percent/100
B = 2.2*(10**9)
FA = B*VVo
