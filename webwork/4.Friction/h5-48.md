## Question Section 

 
A block of mass(5) kg is placed on a ramp that is inclined at an angle of(32^circ) with respect to the horizontal, and then released and slides down the ramp. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the ramp is(0.24).  
(a) Assuming that the block begins to slide down the ramp, determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the block.
