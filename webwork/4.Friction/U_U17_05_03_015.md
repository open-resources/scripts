## Question Section 

<b>
A tightrope walker creates a tension of(Tensiontimes 10^3)(N) in a wire making an angle of(degree^circ) below the horizontal with each supporting pole. Calculate by how much this tension stretches the steel wire if it was originally(Lo)(m) long and(dcm)(cm) in diameter.
ans_rule(40)(m)
## C
below the horizontal with each supporting pole. Calculate by how much this tension stretches the steel wire if it was originally(Lo)(m) long and(dcm)(cm) in diameter.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
degree = randrange(2.0,9.0,1.0)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
Tension = randrange(2.33,7.99,0.02)
T = Tension*(10**3)
Lo = randrange(12.60,20.90,1.2)
F = randrange(4,9,1)
Fa = T*cos(rads)
dcm = randrange(0.20,0.84,0.07)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
Y = 2.10*(10**11)
L = (Lo/Y)*(T/A)
