## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the magnitude of the maximum acceleration of a car that is heading down a(degree^circ) slope (one that makes an angle of(degree^circ) with the horizontal) under the following road conditions. You may assume that the weight of the car is evenly distributed on all four tires and that the coefficient of static friction is involved—that is, the tires are not allowed to slip during the deceleration. (Ignore rolling).
a) On dry concrete:
b) On wet concrete:
c) On ice, assuming that the coefficient of static friction is the same as for shoes on ice:

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
degree = randrange(2.00,9.00,1.00)
rads = degree*((2*pi)/360)
usa = 1.0
g = 9.80
usb = 0.7
usc = 0.1
accelerationa = abs((g)*(-(usa)*cos(rads)+sin(rads)))
accelerationb = abs((g)*(-(usb)*cos(rads)+sin(rads)))
accelerationc = abs((g)*(-(usc)*cos(rads)+sin(rads)))
