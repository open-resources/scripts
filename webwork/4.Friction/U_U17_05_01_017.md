## Question Section 

<b>
Consider the(mass)(kg) mountain climber in the above figure. 
(a) Find the force that the mountain climber must exert with her feet on the vertical rock face to remain stationary. Assume that the force is exerted parallel to her legs. Also, assume negligible force exerted by her arms.

from random import randrange
showHint = 3
showPartialCorrectAnswers = 1

mass = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(50.0,75.0,0.1))
g = 9.8
degreelegs = 15
degreecliff = 31
FL = ((mass)*(g))/((cos(degreelegs*pi/180))/(tan(degreecliff*pi/180))+sin(degreelegs*pi/180))
Tension = (FL)*cos(degreelegs*pi/180)/sin(degreecliff*pi/180)
usmin = tan(degreelegs*pi/180)
