## Question Section 

 
A block of mass(18) kg and a block of mass(6) kg are attached by a massless string that does not stretch. The string is passed over a massless, frictionless pulley. The blocks are released. The blocks slide against vertical walls as they move, which results in a frictional force of(25) N acting on the heavier block and a frictional force of(14) N acting on the lighter block. 
(a) Determine the magnitude of the acceleration of each block.
