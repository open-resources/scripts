## Question Section 

<b>
To maintain a constant speed, the force provided by a car's engine must equal the drag force plus the force of friction of the road (the rolling resistance). 
a) What are the drag forces at(v1km)(kmh) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is(DA1)(m^2)).
b) What are the drag forces at(v2km)(kmh) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is(DA1)(m^2)) 
c) What is the drag force at(v1km)(kmh) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is(DA2)(m^2))
d) What is the drag force at(v2km)(kmh) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is(DA2)(m^2))

from random import randrange
DA1 = randrange(0.60,0.99,0.038)
DA2 = randrange(2.32,4.99,0.19)
v1km = randrange(50.00,90.00,3.00)
v1m = v1km*(1000/3600)
v1 = v1m**2
v2km = randrange(95.00,120.00,2.00)
v2m = v2km*(1000/3600)
v2 = v2m**2
Ca = 0.28
Cb = 0.64
p = 1.21
pd = 2.44
fda = (1/2)*p*Ca*DA1*v1
fdb = (1/2)*p*Ca*DA1*v2
