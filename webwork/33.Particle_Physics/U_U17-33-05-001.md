## Question Section 

a) Verify from its quark composition that the <mtext>Δ<mtext><sup>+<sup> particle could be an excited state of the proton. Enter(u) for an up quark, and(d) for a down quark.
<mtext>Δ<mtext><sup>+<sup> =ans_rule(40)
b) There is a spread of about(100,(MeV) in the decay energy of the , interpreted as uncertainty due to its short lifetime. What is its approximate lifetime?
