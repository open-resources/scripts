## Question Section 

When an electron and positron collide at the SLAC facility, they each have(GeV,(GeV)
kinetic energies. What is the total collision energy available, taking into account the
annihilation energy? Note that the annihilation energy is insignificant, because the
electrons are highly relativistic.
