## Question Section 

<b>
Hydrogen molecules (molecular mass is equal to(Mgtimes 10^-3)(kgmol) have an average velocity equal to(velocity)(ms). What is the temperature?
ans_rule(40)(K)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
velocity = randrange(100,300,0.1)
Mg = 2.016
Mkg = Mg*10**-3
R = 8.314

temp= ((Mkg)*(velocity**2))/(3*R)
