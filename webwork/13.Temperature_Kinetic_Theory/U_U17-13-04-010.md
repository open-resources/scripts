## Question Section 

<b>
There are two important isotopes of uranium —  <sup>235<sup>U and <sup>238<sup>U; these isotopes are nearly identical chemically but have different atomic masses. Only <sup>235<sup>U is very useful in nuclear reactors. One of the techniques for separating them (gas diffusion) is based on the different average velocities (v<sub>rms<sub>) of uranium hexafluoride gas, UF<sub>6<sub>.
a) The molecular masses for  <sup>235<sup>U UF<sub>6<sub>  and <sup>238<sup>U UF<sub>6<sub> are(M235)(kgmol) and(M238)(kgmol), respectively. What is the ratio of their average velocities?

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(1,2,0.01)
M235 = 0.349
M238 = 0.352
R = 8.314

ratio = sqrt(M238/M235)

LHS = ((speed**2)/(3*R))
RHS = ((sqrt(M238)-sqrt(M235))/(sqrt(M238*M235)))**2

temp = (LHS)/(RHS)
