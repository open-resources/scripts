## Question Section 

<b>
What new volume does(Vi)(L) of gasoline initially at(Ti^circC) occupy as the temperature rises to(Tf^circC)? The coefficient of volume expansion for gasoline is(beta0times 10^-6)(^circC^-1).
ans_rule(40)(L)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Vi = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(60,70,0.1))
Ti = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(10,20,0.1))
Tf = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(30,40,0.1))
beta0 = 950
beta1 = beta0*10**-6

deltaV = (Vi)*(beta1)*((Tf)-(Ti))
Vf = Vi+deltaV
