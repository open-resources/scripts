## Question Section 

<b>
Much of the gas near the Sun is atomic hydrogen. Its temperature would have to be (temptimes 10^7)(K) for the average velocity to equal the escape velocity from the Sun. What is that velocity?
ans_rule(40)(ms)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(1,3,0.01)
Mkg = 0.001008
R = 8.314

velocity = sqrt((3*R*temp*10**7)/(Mkg))
