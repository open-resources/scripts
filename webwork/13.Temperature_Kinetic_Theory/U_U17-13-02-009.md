## Question Section 

<b>
a) If a(volume)-(mL) glass beaker is filled to the brim with ethyl alcohol at a temperature of(temp1^circC) how much will overflow when its temperature reaches(temp2^circC)? The coefficient of volume expansion for ethyl alcohol is(betaethanoltimes 10^-3)(^circC^-1). Assume the beaker is initially in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at(temp2^circC) and does not undergo any temperature change as the ethyl alcohol is transferred.

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp1 = randrange(3,10,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(15,30,0.1)

volume = randrange(250,1000,250)

betaethanol = 1.1
betawater = 2.1
be = betaethanol*10**-3
bw = betawater*10**-4

deltaVa = (volume)*(be)*(temp2-temp1)
deltaVb = (volume)*(be-bw)*(temp2-temp1)
