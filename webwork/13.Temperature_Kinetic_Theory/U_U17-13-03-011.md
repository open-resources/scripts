## Question Section 

<b>
The number density of gas atoms at a certain location in the space above our planet is about(densitytimes 10^11)(atomsm^3) and the pressure is(pressuretimes 10^-10)(Nm^2) in this space. What is the temperature there?
ans_rule(40)(K)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
density = randrange(0.5,3.5,0.01)
pressure = randrange(2,4,0.01)

A1 = (pressure)/((density)*(1.38))*100
