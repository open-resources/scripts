## Question Section 

<b>
Convert an absolute pressure of(pressuretimes 10^5)(Nm^2) to gauge pressure in(lbin^2). Normal atmospheric pressure is(1.013times 10^5)(Pa).
ans_rule(40)(lbin^2)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(5,9,0.01)

A1 = (pressure-1.013)*(10**(5))/(6895)
