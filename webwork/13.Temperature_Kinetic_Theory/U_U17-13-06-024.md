## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Suppose the relative humidity is(percent)(%) on a day when the temperature is(30.0^circC). What will the relative humidity be if the air cools to(25.0^circC) and the vapor density remains constant? The saturation vapor density is equal to(30.4)(gm^3) at(30.0^circC) and(23.0)(gm^3) at(25.0^circC).
ans_rule(40)(%)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(76,90,0.1))

A1 = (percent/100)*((30.4)/(23))*100
