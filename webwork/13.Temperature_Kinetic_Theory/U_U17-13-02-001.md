## Question Section 

<b>
The height of the Washington Monument is measured to be(170)(m) on a day when the temperature is(temp1^circC). What will its height be on a day when the temperature falls to(temp2^circC)? Although the monument is made of limestone, assume that its thermal coefficient of expansion is the same as marble's. The thermal coefficient of expansion of marble is(7times 10^-6)(^circC^-1).
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp1 = randrange(30,40,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(-15,-5,0.1)

A1 = (170)+(7*10**(-6))*(temp2-temp1)
