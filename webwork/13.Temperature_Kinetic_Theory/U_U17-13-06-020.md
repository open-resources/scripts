## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> If you want to cook in water at(150 ^circC), you need a pressure cooker that can withstand the necessary pressure.
a) What pressure is required for the boiling point of water to be this high? 
ans_rule(40)(Pa)
## A
What pressure is required for the boiling point of water to be this high? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = 4.76*10**5

pressureatm = 1.013*10**5
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(20,30,0.1))
area = pi*(diameter/200)**2

force = (pressure-pressureatm)*(area)
