## Question Section 

<b>
A deep-sea diver should breathe a gas mixture that has the same oxygen partial pressure as at sea level, where dry air contains(percent)(%) oxygen and has a total pressure of(1.013times 10^5)(Nm^2).
a) What is the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level? 
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)
## A
What is the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(20,21,0.01)
pressure = randrange(1.5,4,0.01)

A1 = (101300)*(percent/100)
A2 = (A1)/(pressure*(1000000))*100
