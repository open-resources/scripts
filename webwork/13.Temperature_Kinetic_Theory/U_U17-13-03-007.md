## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the number of moles in the(volume)-(L) volume of air in the lungs of the average person. Note that the air is at(temp^circC).
ans_rule(40)(mol)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(30,40,0.1)
volume = randrange(1.5,3,0.01)

A1 = (101300)*(volume/1000)/((8.314)*(temp+273.15))
