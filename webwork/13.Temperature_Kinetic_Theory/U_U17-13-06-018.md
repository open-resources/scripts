## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> At what depth in fresh water is the critical pressure of water reached, given that the surface is at sea level? Take the critical pressure to be(2.212times 10^7)(Nm^2) and use(1.01times 10^5)(Nm^2) as the normal atmospheric pressure.
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

A1 = ((22.12*(10**(6)))-(1.01*(10**(5))))/((1000)*(9.8))
