## Question Section 

<b>
What is the dew point on a day when relative humidity is(percent)(%) at a temperature of(20^circC)? The saturation vapor density at(20^circC) is equal to(svd)(gm^3).
ans_rule(40)(^circC)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(30,39,0.1))
ratio = percent*0.01
intercept = 4.84
slope = (6.8-4.84)/5
svd = 17.2                            #Saturation vapour density.

temp = ((svd*ratio)-intercept)/(slope)
