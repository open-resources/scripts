## Question Section 

<b>
The escape velocity from the Moon is much smaller than from Earth and is only(vkm)(kms). At what temperature would hydrogen molecules having a molecular mass is equal to(Mgtimes 10^-3)(kgmol) have an average velocity equal to the Moon's escape velocity?
ans_rule(40)(K)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(5,9,0.01)

vkm = 2.38
vm = (vkm)*1000
R = 8.314
Mg = 2.016
Mkg = (Mg)*0.001
A1 = ((Mkg)*(vm)**2)/(3*R)
