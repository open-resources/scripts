## Question Section 

<b>
Find the number of moles in(2.00)(L) of gas at(temp^circC) and under(pressuretimes 10^7)(Nm^2) of pressure. 
ans_rule(40)(mol)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(30,40,0.1)
pressure = randrange(6,9,0.01)
A1 = (pressure)*(2)/((8.31)*(temp+273.15))*(10000)
