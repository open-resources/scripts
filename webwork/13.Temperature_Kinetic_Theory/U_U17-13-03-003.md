## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a gas-filled incandescent light bulb is manufactured so that the gas inside the bulb is at atmospheric pressure when the bulb has a temperature of(temp^circC).
a) Find the gauge pressure inside such a bulb when it is hot, assuming its average temperature is(temp2^circC) (an approximation) and neglecting any change in volume due to thermal expansion or gas leaks.
ans_rule(40)(atm)
## A
Find the gauge pressure inside such a bulb when it is hot, assuming its average temperature is(temp2^circC) (an approximation) and neglecting any change in volume due to thermal expansion or gas leaks.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(15,25,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(50,60,0.1)
A1 = ((101300)*((temp2+273.15)/(temp+273.15))-(101300))/(101300)
A2 = ((101300)*((temp2+273.15)/(temp+273.15))/(1+(2.7*(10**(-5)))*(temp2-temp))-(101300))/(101300)
