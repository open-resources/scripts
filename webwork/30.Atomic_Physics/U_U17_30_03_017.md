## Question Section 

The wavelength of the four Balmer series lines for hydrogen are found to be(410.3),(434.2),(486.3), and(656.5)(nm). What average percentage difference is found between these wavelength numbers and those predicted by(frac1lambda =(R)((frac1n_f^2 -frac1n_i^2 ))? Express your answer with two significant figures.
It is amazing how well a simple formula (disconnected originally from theory) could duplicate this phenomenon.


## Answer Section

E = 6.5
