## A
What is the shortest-wavelength x-ray radiation that can be generated in an x-ray tube with an applied voltage of(voltage,(kV)?
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate the photon energy in(eV).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(45,55,1)

E = (((6.626*10**-34)*(2.998*10**8))/((1.602*10**-19)*(voltage*10**3)))*10**11
F = voltage
