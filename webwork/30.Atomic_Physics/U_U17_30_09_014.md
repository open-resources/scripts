## Question Section 

In a laboratory experiment designed to duplicate Thomson's determination of(q_em_e) , a beam of electrons having a velocity of(velocity)(times 10^7,(ms) enters a(strength)(times 10^-3,(T) magnetic field. The beam moves perpendicular to the field in a path having a(radius,(cm) radius of curvature. Determine(q_em_e) from these observations.
## E

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
velocity = randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
radius = randrange(6.75,6.85,0.01)


E = (velocity*10**7)/((strength*10**-3)*(radius*10**-2))
