# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose you first walk ($a) m in a direction (20) degrees west of north and then ($b) m in a direction (40) degrees south of west. How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?$BR$BRa) How far are you from your starting point,$BR$BRans_rule(40) m $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$A1"));b) and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?$BR$BRans_rule(40) South of West$BR$BR
