## Part 0 
A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail ( 27.5 ,m ) in a direction ( 66.0^circ) north of east from her current location, and then travel ( 30.0 ,m) in a direction ( 112^circ ) north of east (or (22.0^circ) west of north). 
## Part 1 
What is the resulting displacement?
