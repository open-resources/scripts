# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose that you first walk ( $nw ,m ) in a direction ( $dw ^circ ) west of north and then ( $sw ,m ) in a direction ( $ds ^circ ) south of west. 
## Part 2 
How far are you from your starting point? 
## Part 3 
What is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?
