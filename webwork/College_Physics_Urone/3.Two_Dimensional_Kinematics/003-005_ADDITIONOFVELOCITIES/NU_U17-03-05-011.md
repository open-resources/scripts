# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The velocity of the wind relative to the water is crucial to sailboats. Suppose a sailboat is in an ocean current that has a velocity of ($s,m/s) in a direction ($b^circ) east of north relative to the Earth. It encounters a wind that has a velocity of ($v,m/s) in a direction of ($a^circ) south of west relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the wind relative to the water?
