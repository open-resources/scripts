# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ship sailing in the Gulf Stream is heading ($wdeg^circ) west of north at a speed of ($sw,m/s) relative to the water. Its velocity relative to the Earth is ($se,m/s) ($edeg^circ) west of north. 
## Part 2 
What is the velocity of the Gulf Stream? 
## Part 3 
(The velocity obtained is typical for the Gulf Stream a few hundred kilometers off the east coast of the United States.)
