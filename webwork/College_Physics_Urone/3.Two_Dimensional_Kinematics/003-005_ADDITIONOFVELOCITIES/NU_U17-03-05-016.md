## Part 0 
An ice hockey player is moving at (8.0 ,m/s) when he hits the puck toward the goal. The speed of the puck relative to the player is (29.0 ,m/s). The line between the center of the goal and the player makes a (90^circ) angle relative to his path as shown above. What angle must the puck's velocity make relative to the player (in his frame of reference) to hit the center of the goal? You are trying to find angle (beta), which makes a (90^circ) angle with (theta). 
## Part 1 
The puck will make an angle of ans_rule(40) degrees relative to the player's motion
