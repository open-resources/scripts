## Part 0 
Use the distance and velocity data in the above image to find the rate of expansion as a function of distance. 
## Part 1 
If you extrapolate back in time, how long ago would all of the galaxies have been at approximately the same position? 
## Part 2 
The two parts of this problem give you some idea of how the Hubble constant for universal expansion and the time back to the Big Bang are determined, respectively.
