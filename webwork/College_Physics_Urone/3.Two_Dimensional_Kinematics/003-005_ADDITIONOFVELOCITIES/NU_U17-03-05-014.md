# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An athlete crosses a ($w,m-wide) river by swimming perpendicular to the water current at a speed of ($s,m/s) relative to the water. He reaches the opposite side at a distance ($d,m) downstream from his starting point. 
## Part 2 
How fast is the water in the river flowing with respect to the ground? 
## Part 3 
What is the speed of the swimmer with respect to a friend at rest on the ground?
