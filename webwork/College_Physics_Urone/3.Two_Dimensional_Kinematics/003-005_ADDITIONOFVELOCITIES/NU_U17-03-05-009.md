# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A jet stream is blowing at (45.0 , (m/s) in a direction (20.0^circ) south of east. An airplane moves in a direction (45.0^circ) south of west relative to Earth, and its direction of motion relative to the air is (5.00^circ) south of west. 
## Part 2 
What is the airplane's speed relative to the air? 
## Part 3 
What is the airplane's speed relative to the Earth?
