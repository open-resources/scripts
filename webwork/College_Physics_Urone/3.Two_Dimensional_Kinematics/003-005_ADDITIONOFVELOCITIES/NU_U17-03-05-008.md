# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ship sets sail from Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The localocean current is ($vw , (m/s) in a direction ($degw^circ) north of east. 
## Part 2 
In what direction would the ship have to travel in order to have a velocity straight north relative to the Earth, assuming the boat's speed relative to the water remains ($vb,(m/s)? 
## Part 3 
What would its speed be relative to the Earth?
