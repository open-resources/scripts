# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A commercial airplane has an air speed of ($va,m/s) due east and flies with a strong tailwind. It travels ($d,km) in a direction ($a^circ) south of east in (1.50,h). 
## Part 2 
What was the velocity of the plane relative to the ground? 
## Part 3 
Calculate the magnitude and direction of the tailwind's velocity. 
## Part 4 
Is this reasonable?
