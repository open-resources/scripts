# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An arrow is shot from a height of ($h,m) toward a cliff of height (H). It is shot with a velocity of ($v,m/s) at an angle of ($a^circ) above the horizontal. It lands on the top edge of the cliff ($t,s) later. 
## Part 2 
What is the height of the cliff? 
## Part 3 
What is the maximum height reached by the arrow along its trajectory? 
## Part 4 
What is the arrow's impact speed just before hitting the cliff?
