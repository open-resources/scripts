# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The world long jump record is (8.95 , (m) (Mike Powell, USA, 1991). Treated as a projectile, what is the maximum range obtainable by a person if he has a take-off speed of (9.5 , (m/s)?$PAAssume the motion is on level ground (the person leaves the ground at ground height) and the angle is (45^circ).
