## Part 0 
A new landowner has a triangular piece of flat land she wishes to fence. Starting at the west corner, she measures the first side to be (80.0,m) long and the next to be (105,m). These sides are represented as displacement vectors A and B in the above. She then correctly calculates the length and orientation of the third side, C. What is her result?
