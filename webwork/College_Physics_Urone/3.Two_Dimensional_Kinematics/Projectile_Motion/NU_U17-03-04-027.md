# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In 2007, Michael Carter (U.S.) set a world record in the shot put with a throw of (24.77 , (m). 
## Part 2 
What was the initial speed of the shot if he released it at a height of (2.10 , (m) and threw it at an angle of (38.0^circ) above the horizontal? 
## Part 3 
(Although the maximum distance for a projectile on level ground is achieved at  when air resistance is neglected, the actual angle to achieve maximum range is smaller; thus, will give a longer range than  in the shot put.)
