# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a ($h,m) building and lands ($d,m) from the base of the building. Ignore air resistance. 
## Part 2 
How long is the ball in the air? 
## Part 3 
What must have been the initial horizontal component of the velocity? 
## Part 4 
What is the vertical component of the velocity just before the ball hits the ground? 
## Part 5 
What is the velocity and angle of the ball just before it hits the ground?
