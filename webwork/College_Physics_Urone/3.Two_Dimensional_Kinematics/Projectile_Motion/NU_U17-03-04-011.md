# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An archer shoots an arrow at a ($d ,m) distant target; the bull's-eye of the target is at same height as the release height of the arrow. 
## Part 2 
There is a large tree halfway between the archer and the target with an overhanging horizontal branch (3.50,m) above the release height of the arrow. Will the arrow go over or under the branch? 
## Part 3 
Enter "over" or "under"
