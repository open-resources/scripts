# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Gun sights are adjusted to aim high to compensate for the effect of gravity, effectively making the gun accurate only for a specific range. 
## Part 2 
If a gun is sighted to hit targets that are at the same height as the gun and (100.0 , (m) away, how low will the bullet hit if aimed directly at a target ($d.0 , (m) away? The muzzle velocity of the bullet is ($v , (m/s). 


### Answer Section
