# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In the standing broad jump, one squats and then pushes off with the legs to see how far one can jump. Suppose the extension of the legs from the crouch position is ($d , (m) and the acceleration achieved from this position is ($c , (times)  the acceleration due to gravity,  . How far can they jump? State your assumptions. (Increased range can be achieved by swinging the arms in the direction of the jump.)
