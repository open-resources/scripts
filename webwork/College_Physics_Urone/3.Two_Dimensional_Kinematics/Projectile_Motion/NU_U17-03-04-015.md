# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The cannon on a battleship can fire a shell a maximum distance of (32.0,km). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the initial velocity of the shell. 
## Part 3 
What maximum height does it reach? (At its highest, the shell is above (60%) of the atmosphereâ€”but air resistance is not really negligible as assumed to make this problem easier.) 
## Part 4 
The ocean is not flat, because the Earth is curved. Assume that the radius of the Earth is (6.37times10^3km). How many meters lower will its surface be (32.0km) from the ship along a horizontal line parallel to the surface at the ship? Does your answer imply that error introduced by the assumption of a flat Earth in projectile motion is significant here?
