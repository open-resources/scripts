# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of ($vq,m/s) when he throws a pass to a player ($R,m) straight downfield. 
## Part 2 
If the ball is thrown at an angle of ($deg^circ) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released, what is its initial speed relative to the ground? 
## Part 3 
How long does it take to get to the receiver? 
## Part 4 
What is its maximum height above its point of release?
