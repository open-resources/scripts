# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A rugby player passes the ball ($d,m) across the field, where it is caught at the same height as it left his hand. 
## Part 2 
At what angle was the ball thrown if its initial speed was ($v,m/s), assuming that the smaller of the two possible angles was used? 
## Part 3 
What other angle gives the same range, and why would it not be used? 
## Part 4 
How long did this pass take?
