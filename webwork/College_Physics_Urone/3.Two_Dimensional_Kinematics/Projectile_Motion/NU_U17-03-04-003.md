# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
You fly ($d.0,km) in a straight line in still air in the direction ($t.0^circ) south of west. 
## Part 2 
Find the distances you would have to fly straight south and then straight west to arrive at the same point. 
## Part 3 
Find the distances you would have to fly first directly south-west and then directly north-west.
