# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The free throw line in basketball is ($d,m) ((15 , (ft)) from the basket, which is ($h,m) ((10 , (ft)) above the floor. A player standing on the free throw line throws the ball with an initial speed of ($vo,m/s), releasing it at a height of ($ho,m) ((8 , (ft)) above the floor. At what angle above the horizontal must the ball be thrown to exactly hit the basket? 
## Part 2 
Note that most players will use a large initial angle rather than a flat shot because it allows for a larger margin of error.
