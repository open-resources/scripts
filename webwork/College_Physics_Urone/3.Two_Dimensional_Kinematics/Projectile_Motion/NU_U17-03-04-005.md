# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In an attempt to escape his island, Gilligan builds a raft and sets to sea. The wind shifts a great deal during the day, and he is blown along the following straight lines: 
## Part 2 
(2.50,km,,45.0^circ) north of west; then (4.70,km,,60.0^circ) south of east; then (1.30,km,,25.0^circ) south of west; then (5.10,km,) east; then (1.70,km,,5.00^circ) east of north; then (7.2,km,,55.0^circ) south of west; then (2.80,km,,10.0^circ) north of east. What is his final position relative to his starting point?
