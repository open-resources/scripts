# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A projectile is launched at ground level with an initial speed of ($i,m/s) at an angle of ($a^circ) above the horizontal. It strikes a target above the ground ($t) seconds later. What are the x and y distances from where the projectile was launched to where it lands?
