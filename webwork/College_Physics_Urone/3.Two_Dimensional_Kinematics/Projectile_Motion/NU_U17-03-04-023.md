# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An owl is carrying a mouse to the chicks in its nest. Its position at that time is (4.00,m) west and (12.0,m) above the center of the (30.0,cm) diameter nest. The owl is flying east at (3.50,m/s) at an angle (30^circ) below the horizontal when it accidentally drops the mouse. Is the owl lucky enough to have the mouse hit the nest? 
## Part 2 
To answer this question, calculate the horizontal position of the mouse when it has fallen (12.0,m). 
## Part 3 
Enter "yes" or "no"
