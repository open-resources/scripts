# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Near the end of a marathon race, the first two runners are separated by a distance of ($d1m). The front runner has a velocity of ($vfm/s), and the second a velocity of ($vsm/s). 
## Part 2 
What is the velocity of the second runner relative to the first? 
## Part 3 
If the front runner is ($d2m) from the finish line, who will win the race, assuming they run at constant velocity? 
## Part 4 
Enter "first" for the first runner or "second" for the second runner. 
## Part 5 
What distance ahead will the winner be when she crosses the finish line?
