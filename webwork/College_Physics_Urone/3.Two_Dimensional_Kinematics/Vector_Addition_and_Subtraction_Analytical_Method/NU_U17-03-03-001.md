# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A basketball player is running at  ($v , (m/s) directly toward the basket when he jumps into the air to dunk the ball. He maintains his horizontal velocity. 
## Part 2 
What vertical velocity does he need to rise (0.750 , (m) above the floor? 
## Part 3 
How far from the basket (measured in the horizontal direction) must he start his jump to reach his maximum height at the same time as he reaches the basket?
