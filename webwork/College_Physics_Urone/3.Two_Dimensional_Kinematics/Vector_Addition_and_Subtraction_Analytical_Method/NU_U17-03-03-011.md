# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of ($v,m/s) when he throws a pass to a player ($d,m) straight downfield. The ball is thrown at an angle of ($a^circ) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released. What is the initial velocity of the ball relative to the quarterback?
