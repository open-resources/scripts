# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A seagull flies at a velocity of ($v ,m/s) straight into the wind. 
## Part 2 
If it takes the bird ($t ,min) to travel ($d,km) relative to the Earth, what is the velocity of the wind? 
## Part 3 
If the bird turns around and flies with the wind, how long will he take to return ($d,km)?
