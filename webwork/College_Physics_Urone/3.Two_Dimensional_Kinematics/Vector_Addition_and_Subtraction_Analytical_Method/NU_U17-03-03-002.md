# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A football player punts the ball at a (45^circ) angle. Without an effect from the wind, the ball would travel ($d.0 , (m) horizontally. 
## Part 2 
What is the initial speed of the ball? 
## Part 3 
When the ball is near its maximum height it experiences a brief gust of wind that reduces its horizontal velocity by ($v , (m/s). What distance does the ball travel horizontally?
