# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Bryan Allen pedaled a human-powered aircraft across the English Channel from the cliffs of Dover to Cap Gris-Nez on June 12, 1979. 
## Part 2 
He flew for (169 , (min) at an average velocity of (3.53 , (m/s) in a direction south of east. What was his total displacement? 
## Part 3 
Allen encountered a headwind averaging (2.00 , (m/s) almost precisely in the opposite direction of his motion relative to the Earth. What was his average velocity relative to the air? 
## Part 4 
What was his total displacement relative to the air mass?
