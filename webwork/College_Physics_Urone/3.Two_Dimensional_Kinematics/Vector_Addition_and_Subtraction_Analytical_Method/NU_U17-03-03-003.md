# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Prove that the trajectory of a projectile is parabolic, having the form (y=ax+bx^2). To obtain this expression, solve the equation (x=v_oxt) for (t) and substitute it into the expression for (y=v_oyt-(1/2)gt^2). 
## Part 2 
(These equations describe the (x) and (y) positions of a projectile that starts at the origin.) You should obtain an equation of the form (y=ax+bx^2) where (a) and (b) are constants. 
## Part 3 
When entering your answers use t for (theta), g for (g) and v for (v_o). 
## Part 4 
a = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 5 
b = ans_rule(40)
