# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Integrated Concepts Find the amount of energy given to the (^4)He nucleus and to the (gamma) ray in the reaction (n)+(^3)He->(^4)He+(gamma), using the conservation of momentum principle and taking the reactants to be initially at rest. This should confirm the contention that most of the energy goes to the (gamma) ray.$BR$BRans_rule(40) MeV$BR$BR
