# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The annual radiation dose from (^14C) in our bodies is (0.01) mSv/y. Each (^14C) decay emits a (beta^-) averaging (0.0750) MeV. Taking the fraction of (^14C) to be (1.3 times 10^-12) of normal (^12C) and assuming the body is (13)% carbon, estimate the fraction of the decay energy absorbed. (The rest escapes, exposing those close to you.)
