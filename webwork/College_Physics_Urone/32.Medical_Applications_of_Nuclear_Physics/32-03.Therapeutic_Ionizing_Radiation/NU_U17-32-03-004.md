# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A cancer patient is exposed to (gamma) rays from a (5000)-Ci (^60Co) transillumination unit for ($time) s. The (gamma) rays are collimated in such a manner that only (1.00)% of them strike the patient. Of those, (20.0)% are absorbed in a tumor having a mass of ($mass) kg. What is the dose in rem to the tumor, if the average (gamma) energy per decay is (1.25) MeV? 
## Part 2 
None  of the (beta) s from the decay reach the patient.
