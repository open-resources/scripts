# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If everyone in Australia received an extra ($mSv) mSv per year of radiation, what would  be the increase in the number of cancer deaths per year? (Assume that time had  elapsed for the effects to become apparent.) Assume that there are ($deathsa times 10^-4) deaths per Sv of radiation per year. What percent of the actual number of cancer deaths recorded is this? 
## Part 2 
What percent of the actual number of cancer deaths recorded is this? 
## Part 3 
Note: The cancer deaths are (43000).
