# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Naturally occurring (^40K) is listed as responsible for ($rem) mrem/y of background radiation. Calculate the mass of (^40K) that must be inside the ($massbody)-kg body of a woman to produce this dose. Each (^40)K decay emits a ($MeV)-MeV (beta), and ($percent)% of the energy is absorbed inside the body.
