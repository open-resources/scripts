# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Large amounts of (^65Zn) are produced in copper exposed to accelerator beams. While machining contaminated copper, a physicist ingests ($uCi) Î¼Ci of (^65Zn). Each (^65Zn) decay emits an average (gamma) -ray energy of ($MeV) MeV, ($percent)% of which is absorbed in the scientist's ($mass)-kg body. What dose in mSv is caused by this in one day?
