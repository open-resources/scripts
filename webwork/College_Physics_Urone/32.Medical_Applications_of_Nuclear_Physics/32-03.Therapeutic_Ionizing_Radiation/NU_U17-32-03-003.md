# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the dose in Sv to the chest of a patient given an x-ray under the following conditions. The x-ray beam intensity is ($Intensity) (W/m^2) , the area of the chest exposed is ($Area) (m^2), ($percent)% of the x-rays are absorbed in ($mass) kg of tissue, and the exposure time is ($time) s.
