# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
This problem gives some idea of the magnitude of the energy yield of a small tacticalbomb. Assume that half the energy of a ($kT)-kT nuclear depth charge set off under anaircraft carrier goes into lifting it out of the waterâ€”that is, into gravitationalpotential energy. How high is the carrier lifted if its mass is ($mass) tons?$BR$BRans_rule(40) km$BR$BR
