It is estimated that the total explosive yield of all the nuclear bombs in existencecurrently is about ($massMT) MT. $BRa) Convert this amount of energy to kilowatt-hours, noting that (1) kWh = (3.60 times 10^6) J. $BR$BRans_rule(40) kWh$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$kWh"));b) What would the monetary value of this energy be if it could be converted to electricity costing ($cents) cents per kWÂ·h?$BR$BRans_rule(40) dollars$BR$BR
