# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A radiation-enhanced nuclear weapon (or neutron bomb) can have a smaller totalyield and still produce more prompt radiation than a conventional nuclear bomb. Thisallows the use of neutron bombs to kill nearby advancing enemy forces with radiationwithout blowing up your own forces with the blast. For a ($massradiation)-kT radiation enhancedweapon and a ($massconventional)-kT conventional nuclear bomb: $BRa) What is the blast yield for the radiation enhanced weapon?$BR$BRans_rule(40) J$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$radiationyield"));b) What is the blast yield for the conventional bomb?$BR$BRans_rule(40) J$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$conventionalyield"));c) Calculate the prompt radiation yield for the radiation enhanced weapon.$BR$BRans_rule(40) J$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$radiationprompt"));d) Calculate the prompt radiation yield for the conventional bomb.$BR$BRans_rule(40) J$BR$BR
