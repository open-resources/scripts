# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The electrical power output of a large nuclear reactor facility is ($PowerE) MW. It has a($percent)% efficiency in converting nuclear power to electrical. $BRa) What is the thermal nuclear power output in megawatts? $BR$BRans_rule(40) MW$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$PowerN"));b) How many (^235)U nuclei fission each second, assuming the average fission produces ($MeV) MeV? $BR$BRans_rule(40) fission/s$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$n"));c) What mass of (^235)U is fissioned in one year of full-power operation?$BR$BRans_rule(40) kg$BR$BR
