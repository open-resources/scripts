# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The naturally occurring radioactive isotope (^232)Th does not make good fission fuel,because it has an even number of neutrons; however, it can be bred into a suitablefuel (much as (^238)U is bred into (^239)P). $BRa) What is (Z) for (^232)Th?$BR$BRans_rule(40)$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Z"));a) What is (N) for (^232)Th?$BR$BRans_rule(40)$BR$BR
