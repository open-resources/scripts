# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A large power reactor that has been in operation for some months is turned off, butresidual activity in the core still produces ($Power) MW of power. If the average energy per decay of the fission products is ($MeV) MeV, what is the core activity in curies?$BR$BRans_rule(40) Ci$BR$BR
