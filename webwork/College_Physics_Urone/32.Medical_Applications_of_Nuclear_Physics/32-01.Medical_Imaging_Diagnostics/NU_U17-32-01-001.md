# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A neutron generator uses an (alpha) source, such as radium, to bombard beryllium, inducing the reaction (^4He+^9Be) -> (^12C+n). Such neutron sources are called RaBesources, or PuBe sources if they use plutonium to get the (alpha) s. Calculate the energy output of the reaction in MeV.
