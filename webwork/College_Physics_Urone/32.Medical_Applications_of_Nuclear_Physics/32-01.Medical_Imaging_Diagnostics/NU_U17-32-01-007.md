# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Neutron activation of sodium, which is 100% (^23Na), produces (^24Na), which is used in some heart scans. The equation for the reaction is (^23Na+n) --> (^24Na+gamma). 
## Part 2 
Find its energy output, given the mass of (^23Na) is ($massNa23) u and (^24Na) is ($massNa) u. 
## Part 3 
What mass of (^24Na) produces the needed ($mCi)-mCi activity, given its half-life is ($time) h?
