# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The activities of (^131I) and (^123I) used in thyroid scans are given to be ($uCi131) and ($uCi123)Î¼Ci , respectively. Find the masses of (^131I) and (^123I) in such scans, given their respective half-lives are ($time131) d and ($time123) h. The masses are so small that the radio iodine is usually mixed with stable iodine as a carrier to ensure normal chemistry and distribution in the body.
