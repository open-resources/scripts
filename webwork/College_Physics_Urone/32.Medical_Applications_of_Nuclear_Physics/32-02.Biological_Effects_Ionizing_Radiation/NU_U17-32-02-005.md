# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
One half the (gamma) rays from (^99mTc) are absorbed by a ($thick)-mm-thick lead shielding. Half of the (gamma) rays that pass through the first layer of lead are absorbed in a second layer of equal thickness. What thickness of lead will absorb all but one in (1000) of these (gamma) rays?
