# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In an air conditioner, ($heat) (MJ) of heat transfer occurs from a cold environment in (1.00) (h). The latent heat is equal to (3.34 times 10^5) (J/kg). 
## Part 1 
What mass of ice melting would involve the same heat transfer? 
## Part 2 
How many hours of operation would be equivalent to melting ($massSI) (kg) of ice?
