# {{ params.vars.title }}![Microstates Table](NU_U17-15-07-006.png)

## Part 0 
If you toss (10) coins, what percent of the time will you get the three most likely macrostates? 
## Part 1 
You can realistically toss (10) coins and count the number of heads and tails about twice a minute. At that rate, how long will it take on average to get either (10) heads and (0) tails or (0) heads and (10) tails?
