## Part 0 
What is the change in entropy if you start with (100) coins in the (45) heads and (55) tails macrostate, toss them, and get (51) heads and (49) tails? 
## Part 1 
What if you get (75) heads and (25) tails? 
## Part 2 
How much more likely is (51) heads and (49) tails than (75) heads and (25) tails?
