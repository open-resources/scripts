# {{ params.vars.title }}![Microstates Table](NU_U17-15-07-007.png)

## Part 0 
Construct a table showing the macrostates and all of the individual microstates for tossing (6) coins, using the one above as a guide. 
## Part 1 
How many macrostates exist in tossing (6) coins? 
## Part 2 
How many microstates? 
## Part 3 
What percent chance is there of tossing (5) heads and (1) tail? 
## Part 4 
How much more likely are you to toss (3) heads and (3) tails than (5) heads and (1) tail?
