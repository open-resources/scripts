# {{ params.vars.title }}![Microstates Table](NU_U17-15-07-003.png)

## Part 0 
If tossing (100) coins, how many ways (microstates) are there to get the three most likely macrostates of (49) heads and (51) tails, (50) heads and (50) tails, and (51) heads and (49) tails? 
## Part 1 
What percent of the total possibilities is this?
