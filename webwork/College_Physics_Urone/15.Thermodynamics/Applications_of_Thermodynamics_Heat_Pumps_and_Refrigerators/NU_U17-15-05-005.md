# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the best coefficient of performance for a heat pump that has a hot reservoir temperature of ($temp^circC) and a cold reservoir temperature of ($temp2^circC)? 
## Part 1 
How much heat transfer occurs into the warm environment if ($work times 10^7) J of work is put into it? There are (4186) (J/kcal).
