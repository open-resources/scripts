# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the best coefficient of performance for a refrigerator that cools an environment at ($temp^circC) and has heat transfer to another environment at ($temp2^circC)? 
## Part 1 
How much work in joules must be done for a heat transfer of ($heat) (kJ) from the cold environment? There are (4186) (J/kcal). 
## Part 2 
What is the cost of doing this if the work costs (10.0) cents per (3.60 times 10^6) (J) (a kilowatt-hour)? 
## Part 3 
How many (kJ) of heat transfer occurs into the warm environment?
