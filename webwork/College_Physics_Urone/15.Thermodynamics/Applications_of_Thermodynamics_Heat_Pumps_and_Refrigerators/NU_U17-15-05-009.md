# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A (4)-ton air conditioner removes ($heat times 10^7) (J) from a cold environment in one hour. 
## Part 1 
What energy input in joules is necessary to do this if the air conditioner has an energy efficiency rating of ($perf)? There are (1055) (J/BTU). 
## Part 2 
What is the cost of doing this if the work costs (10.0) cents per (3.6 times 10^6) (J) (one kilowatt-hour)?
