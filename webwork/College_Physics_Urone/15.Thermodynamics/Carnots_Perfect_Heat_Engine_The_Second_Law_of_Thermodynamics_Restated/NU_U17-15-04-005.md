# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Practical steam engines utilize ($temp^circC) steam, which is later exhausted at ($temp2^circC) . 
## Part 1 
What is the maximum efficiency that such a heat engine can have? 
## Part 2 
Since ($temp2^circC) steam is still quite hot, a second steam engine is sometimes operated using the exhaust of the first. What is the maximum efficiency of the second engine if its exhaust has a temperature of ($temp3^circC)? 
## Part 3 
What is the overall efficiency of the two engines?
