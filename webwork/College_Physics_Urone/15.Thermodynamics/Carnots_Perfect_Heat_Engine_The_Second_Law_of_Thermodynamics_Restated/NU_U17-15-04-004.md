# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Steam locomotives have an efficiency of ($eff)(%) and operate with a hot steam temperature of ($temp^circC) . 
## Part 1 
What would the cold reservoir temperature be if this were a Carnot engine? 
## Part 2 
What would the maximum efficiency of this steam engine be if its cold reservoir temperature were ($temp2^circC)?
