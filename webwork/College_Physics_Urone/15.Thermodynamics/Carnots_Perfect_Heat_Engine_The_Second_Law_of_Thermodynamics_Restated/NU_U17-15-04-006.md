# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A coal-fired electrical power station has an efficiency of ($eff)(%). The temperature of the steam leaving the boiler is  ($temp^circC) . What percentage of the maximum efficiency does this station obtain? (Assume the temperature of the environment is  ($temp2^circC).)
