# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What maximum efficiency can be obtained from an engine operating between ($templow) (K) and ($temphigh) (K)? 
## Part 1 
An inventor claims to have built an engine that extracts ($workdone) (kJ) of useful work from ($heatinput) (kJ) of heat supplied and that operates at the aforementioned temperatures. What is this real heat engine's efficiency?
