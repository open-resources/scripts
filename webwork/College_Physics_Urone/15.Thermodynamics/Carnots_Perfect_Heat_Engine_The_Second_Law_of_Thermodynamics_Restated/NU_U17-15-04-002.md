# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A gas-cooled nuclear reactor operates between hot and cold reservoir temperatures of ($temp^circC) and  ($temp2^circC). 
## Part 1 
What is the maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between these temperatures? 
## Part 2 
Find the ratio of this efficiency to the Carnot efficiency of a standard nuclear reactor which is equal to ($eff) (%).
