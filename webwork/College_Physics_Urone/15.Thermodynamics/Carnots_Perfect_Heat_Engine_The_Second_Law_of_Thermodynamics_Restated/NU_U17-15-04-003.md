# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the hot reservoir temperature of a Carnot engine that has an efficiency of ($eff)(%) and a cold reservoir temperature of ($temp^circC)? 
## Part 1 
What must the hot reservoir temperature be for a real heat engine that achieves ($eff2)(%) of the maximum efficiency, but still has an efficiency of ($eff)(%)?
