# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A cyclical heat engine, operating between temperatures of ($T1^circC) and ($T2^circC) produces ($work) (MJ) of work on a heat transfer of ($transfer) (MJ) into the engine. How much heat transfer occurs to the environment? 
## Part 1 
Calculate the efficiency, expressed as a fraction.
