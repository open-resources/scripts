# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A hand-driven tire pump has a piston with a ($diameter)-(cm) diameter and a maximum stroke of ($stroke) (cm). 
## Part 1 
How much work do you do in one stroke if the average gauge pressure is  ($pressure times 10^5) (N/m^2)? 
## Part 2 
What average force do you exert on the piston, neglecting friction and gravitational force?
