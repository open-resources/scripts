# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Steam to drive an old-fashioned steam locomotive is supplied at a constant gauge pressure of ($pressure times 10^6) (N/m^2) to a piston with a ($radius) (m) radius. 
## Part 1 
Find the work done by the steam when the piston moves ($distance) (m). Note that this is the net work output, since gauge pressure is used. 
## Part 2 
Now find the amount of work by calculating the force exerted times the distance traveled. Is the answer the same as in part (a)?
