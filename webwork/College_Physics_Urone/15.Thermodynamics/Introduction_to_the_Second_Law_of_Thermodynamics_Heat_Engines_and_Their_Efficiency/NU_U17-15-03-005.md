# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The engine of a large ship does ($work times 10^8) (J) of work with an efficiency of ($eff) (%). 
## Part 1 
How much heat transfer occurs to the environment? 
## Part 2 
How many barrels of fuel are consumed, if each barrel produces ($transfer times 10^9) (J) of heat transfer when burned?
