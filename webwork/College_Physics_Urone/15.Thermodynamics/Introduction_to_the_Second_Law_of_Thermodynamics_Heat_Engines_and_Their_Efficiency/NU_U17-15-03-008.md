# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
This problem compares the energy output and heat transfer to the environment by two different types of nuclear power stationsâ€”one with the normal efficiency of ($eff)(%), and another with an improved efficiency of ($eff2)(%). Suppose both have the same heat transfer into the engine in one day, ($heat times 10^14) (J). 
## Part 1 
How much more electrical energy is produced by the more efficient power station? 
## Part 2 
How much less heat transfer occurs to the environment by the more efficient power station? (One type of more efficient nuclear power station, the gas-cooled reactor, has not been reliable enough to be economically feasible in spite of its greater efficiency.)
