# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the efficiency of a cyclical heat engine in which ($heat) (kJ) of heat transfer occurs to the environment for every ($transfer) (kJ) of heat transfer into the engine? 
## Part 1 
How much work does it produce for ($transfer2) (kJ) of heat transfer into the engine?
