# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A certain heat engine does ($work) (kJ) of work and ($transfer) (KJ) of heat transfer occurs to the environment in a cyclical process. 
## Part 1 
What was the heat transfer into this engine? 
## Part 2 
What was the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage?
