# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
With ($heat times 10^6) (J) of heat transfer into this engine, a given cyclical heat engine can do only  ($work times 10^5) (J) of work. 
## Part 1 
What is the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage? 
## Part 2 
How much heat transfer to the environment takes place?
