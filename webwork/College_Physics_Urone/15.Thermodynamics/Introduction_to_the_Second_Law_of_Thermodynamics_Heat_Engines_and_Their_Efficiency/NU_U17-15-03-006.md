# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How much heat transfer occurs to the environment by an electrical power station that uses ($heat times 10^14) (J) of heat transfer into the engine with an efficiency of ($eff)(%)? 
## Part 1 
What is the ratio of heat transfer to the environment to work output? 
## Part 2 
How much work is done?
