# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Assume that the turbines at a coal-powered power plant were upgraded, resulting in an improvement in efficiency of ($eff)(%). Assume that prior to the upgrade the power station had an efficiency of ($eff2)(%) and that the heat transfer into the engine in one day is still the same at ($heat times 10^14) (J). 
## Part 1 
How much more electrical energy is produced due to the upgrade? 
## Part 2 
What difference in heat transfer occurs to the environment due to the upgrade?
