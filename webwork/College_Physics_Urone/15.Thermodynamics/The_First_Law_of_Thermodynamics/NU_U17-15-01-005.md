# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a woman does ($work) (J) of work and ($heat) (J) of heat transfer occurs into the environment in the process. 
## Part 1 
What is the decrease in her internal energy, assuming no change in temperature or consumption of food? (That is, there is no other energy transfer.) 
## Part 2 
What is her efficiency, expressed as a fraction?
