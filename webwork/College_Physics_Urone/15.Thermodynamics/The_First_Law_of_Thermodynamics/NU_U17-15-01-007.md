# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the average metabolic rate in watts of a man who metabolizes ($energy) (kJ) of food energy in one day? 
## Part 1 
What is the maximum amount of work in joules he can do without breaking down fat, assuming a maximum efficiency of ($eff)(%)? 
## Part 2 
Compare his work output with the daily output of a (187)-(W) motor. 
## Part 3 
The motor produces ans_rule(10) times the work done by the man.
