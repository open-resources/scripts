# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How much heat transfer occurs from ($mass) (kg) of ($temphigh^circC) water placed in contact with ($mass) (kg) of ($templow^circC) water, producing a final temperature of ($tempave^circC)? 
## Part 1 
How much work could a Carnot engine do with this heat transfer, assuming it operates between two reservoirs at constant temperatures of ($temphigh^circC) and ($templow^circC)?
