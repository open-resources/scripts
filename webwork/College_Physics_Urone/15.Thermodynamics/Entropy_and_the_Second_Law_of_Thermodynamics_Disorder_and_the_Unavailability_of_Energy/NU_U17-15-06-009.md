# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A large electrical power station generates ($power) (MW) of electricity with an efficiency of ($eff)(%). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the heat transfer to the power station in one day. 
## Part 2 
How much heat transfer occurs to the environment in one day? 
## Part 3 
If the heat transfer in the cooling towers is from ($tempwater^circC) water into the local air mass, which increases in temperature from ($templow^circC) to ($temphigh^circC), what is the total increase in entropy due to this heat transfer? 
## Part 4 
How much energy becomes unavailable to do work because of this increase in entropy, assuming a ($templow^circC) lowest temperature?
