# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
On a winter day, a certain house loses ($heat times 10^8) (J) of heat to the outside. What is the total change in entropy due to this heat transfer alone, assuming an average indoor temperature of ($temp^circC) and an average outdoor temperature of  ($temp2^circC)?
