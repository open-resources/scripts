# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The Sun radiates energy at the rate of ($rate times 10^26) (W) from its (6000) (K) surface into dark empty space. The effective temperature of deep space is (-270^circC). 
## Part 1 
What is the increase in entropy in one day due to this heat transfer? 
## Part 2 
How much work is made unavailable?
