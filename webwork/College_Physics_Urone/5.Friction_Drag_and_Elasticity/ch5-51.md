# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A block of mass (15) kg rests on a frictionless table top in contact with a block that has mass (5) kg, with the heavier block on the left and the lighter block on the right.   $BR 
## Part 2 
(a) You exert a horizontal force on the heavier block, directed towards the right, that has magnitude (50) N. Determine the magnitude of the force that each block exerts on the other.  $BR ans_rule(20)  N 
## Part 3 
(b) You exert a horizontal force on the lighter block, directed towards the left, that has magnitude (50) N. Determine the magnitude of the force that each block exerts on the other.  $BR ans_rule(20)  N
