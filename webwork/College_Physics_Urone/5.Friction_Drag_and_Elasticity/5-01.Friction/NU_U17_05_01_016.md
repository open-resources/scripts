# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A freight train consists of two ($trainm times 10^5) (kg) engines and (45) cars with average masses of ($caram times 10^5) (kg) . 
## Part 1 
What force must each engine exert backward on the track to accelerate the train at a rate of ($alpha times 10^-2) (m/s^2) if the force of friction is ($fof times 10^5) (N), assuming the engines exert identical forces? This is not a large frictional force for such a massive system. Rolling friction for trains is small, and consequently trains are very energy-efficient transportation systems. 
## Part 2 
What is the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the (37)th and (38)th cars (this is the force each exerts on the other), assuming all cars have the same mass and that friction is evenly distributed among all of the cars and engines?
