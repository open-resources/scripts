# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A contestant in a winter sporting event pushes a ($mass)-(kg) block of ice across a frozen lake as shown in part (a) the above figure. 
## Part 1 
(a) Calculate the minimum force (F) he must exert to get the block moving. 
## Part 2 
(b) What is the magnitude of its acceleration once it starts to move, if that force is maintained? 
## Part 3 
Suppose the contestant now pulls the block as shown in part (b) of the figure. 
## Part 4 
(c) Calculate the minimum force (F') he must exert to get the block moving. 
## Part 5 
(d) What is the magnitude of its acceleration once it starts to move, if that force is maintained?
