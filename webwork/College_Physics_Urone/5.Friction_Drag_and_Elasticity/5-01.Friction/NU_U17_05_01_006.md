# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A team of eight dogs pulls a sled with waxed wood runners on wet snow (mush!). The dogs have average masses of (19.0) (kg), and the loaded sled with its rider has a mass of (210) (kg). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of ($fa) (N) backward on the snow. 
## Part 2 
What is the magnitude of the acceleration once the sled starts to move? 
## Part 3 
Calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled for the first situation. 
## Part 4 
Calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled for the second situation.
