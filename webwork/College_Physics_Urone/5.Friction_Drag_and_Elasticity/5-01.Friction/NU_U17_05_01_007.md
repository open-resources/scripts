# {{ params.vars.title }}![Figure Skaters.](NU_U17_05_01_007/NU_U17_05_01_007.png)

## Part 0 
Consider the ($mass) (kg) ice skater being pushed by two others shown in the above figure. The coefficient of static friction between the steel blades of her skates and the ice is ($us) and the coefficient of kinetic friction is ($uk). 
## Part 1 
Find the magnitude of the total force exerted on her by the others, given that the magnitudes (F_1) and (F_2) are ($F1) (N) and ($F2) (N), respectively. 
## Part 2 
In which direction does the total force act? 
## Part 3 
What is her initial acceleration if she is initially stationary and wearing steel-bladed skates that point in the direction of the total force? 
## Part 4 
What is her acceleration assuming she is already moving in the direction of the total force? (Remember that friction always acts in the direction opposite that of motion or attempted motion between surfaces in contact).
