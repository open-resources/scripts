# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have a ($m) (kg) wooden crate resting on a wood floor. 
## Part 1 
What maximum force can you exert horizontally on the crate without moving it? 
## Part 2 
If you continue to exert this force once the crate starts to slip, what will the magnitude of its acceleration then be?
