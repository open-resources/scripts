# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the maximum acceleration of a car that is heading up a ($degree^circ) slope (one that makes an angle of ($degree^circ) with the horizontal) under the following road conditions.Assume that only half the weight of the car is supported by the two drive wheels andthat the coefficient of static friction is involved—that is, the tires are not allowed toslip during the acceleration. (Ignore rolling). 
## Part 1 
On dry concrete: 
## Part 2 
On wet concrete: 
## Part 3 
On ice, assuming that the coefficient of static friction is the same as for shoes on ice:
