# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The leftmost wire supporting a traffic light makes an angle ($degree^circ) below the horizontal with the top of its pole and carries a tension of ($T , N). The ($Lo , m) tall hollow aluminum pole is equivalent in strength to a ($dcm , cm) diameter solid cylinder. 
## Part 1 
How far is the pole bent to the side? 
## Part 2 
By how much is it compressed?
