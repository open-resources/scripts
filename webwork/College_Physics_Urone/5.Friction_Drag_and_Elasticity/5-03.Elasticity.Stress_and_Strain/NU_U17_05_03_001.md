# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During a circus act, one performer swings upside down hanging from a trapeze while holding another, also upside-down, performer by the legs. If the upward force on the lower performer is three times her weight, how much do the bones (the femurs) in each of her upper legs stretch? You may assume each is equivalent to a uniform rod ($Locm) (cm) long and ($rcm) (cm) in radius. Her mass is ($m) (kg).
