# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The “lead” in pencils is a graphite composite with a Young's modulus of about (1.00 times 10^9) (N/m^2). Calculate the change in length of the lead in an automatic pencil if you tap it straight into the pencil with a force of ($F) (N). The lead is ($dmm) (mm) in diameter and ($Lomm) (mm) long.
