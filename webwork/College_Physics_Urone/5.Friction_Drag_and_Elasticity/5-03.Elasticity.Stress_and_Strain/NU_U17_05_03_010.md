# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A disk between vertebrae in the spine is subjected to a shearing force of ($F) (N). Find its shear deformation, taking it to have a shear modulus of (1.00 times 10^9) (N/m^2). The disk is equivalent to a solid cylinder ($Locm) (cm) high and ($dcm) (cm) in diameter.
