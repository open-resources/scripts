# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by ($percent)(%) (that is, (Î”V/V_circ) = ($VVo)) relative to the space available. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square metre if its bulk modulus is ($Bulk times 10^9) (N/m^2).
