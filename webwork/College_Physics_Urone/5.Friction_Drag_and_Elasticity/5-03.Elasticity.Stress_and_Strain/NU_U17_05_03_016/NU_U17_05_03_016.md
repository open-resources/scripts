# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The pole in the above figure is at a right angle bend in a power line and is therefore subjected to more shear force than poles in straight parts of the line. The tension in each line is ($ti times 10^4) (N), at the angles shown. The pole is ($height) (m) tall, has a ($d) (cm) diameter, and can be considered to have half the stiffness of hardwood. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the compression of the pole caused by the power lines (excluding the guy wire). 
## Part 2 
Determine how far the pole bends. 
## Part 3 
Find the tension in a guy wire used to keep the pole straight if it is attached to the top of the pole at an angle of ($degreesguy^circ) with the vertical. (Clearly, the guy wire must be in the opposite direction of the bend).
