# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
When using a pencil eraser, you exert a vertical force of ($F) (N) at a distance of ($Locm) (cm) from the hardwood-eraser joint. The pencil is ($dmm) (mm) in diameter and is held at an angle of ($degree^circ) to the horizontal. 
## Part 1 
By how much does the wood flex perpendicular to its length? 
## Part 2 
How much is it compressed lengthwise?
