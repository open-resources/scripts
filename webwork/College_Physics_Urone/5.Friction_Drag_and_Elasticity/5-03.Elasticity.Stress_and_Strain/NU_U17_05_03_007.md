# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
As an oil well is drilled, each new section of drill pipe supports its own weight and thatof the pipe and drill bit beneath it. Calculate the stretch in a new ($Lo) (m) length ofsteel pipe that supports ($km) (km) of pipe having a mass of ($mkgm) (kg/m) and a ($mbit) (kg) drill bit. The pipe is equivalent in strength to a solid cylinder ($dcm) (cm) in diameter.
