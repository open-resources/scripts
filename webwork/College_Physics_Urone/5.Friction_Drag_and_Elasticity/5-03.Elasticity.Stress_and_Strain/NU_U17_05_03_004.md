# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
TV broadcast antennas are the tallest artificial structures on Earth. In 1987, a ($mp) (kg)physicist placed himself and ($me) (kg) of equipment at the top of one ($Lo) (m) high antenna to perform gravity experiments. By how much was the antenna compressed,if we consider it to be equivalent to a steel cylinder ($r) (m) in radius?
