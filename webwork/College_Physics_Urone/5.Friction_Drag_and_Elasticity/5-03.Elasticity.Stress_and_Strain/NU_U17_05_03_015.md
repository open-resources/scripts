# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A tightrope walker creates a tension of ($Tension times 10^3) (N) in a wire making an angle of ($degree^circ) below the horizontal with each supporting pole. Calculate by how much this tension stretches the steel wire if it was originally ($Lo) (m) long and ($dcm) (cm) in diameter.
