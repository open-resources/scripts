# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the speed a spherical rain drop would achieve falling from ($xkm) (km). 
## Part 1 
Assume that there is no air drag. 
## Part 2 
Assume that there is air drag. Take the diameter of the drop to be ($dmm) (mm), the density to be ($density times 10^3) (kg/m^3), and the cross-sectional area to be (pi r^2).
