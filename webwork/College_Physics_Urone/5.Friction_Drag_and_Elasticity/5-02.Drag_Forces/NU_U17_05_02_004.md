# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
To maintain a constant speed, the force provided by a car's engine must equal the drag force plus the force of friction of the road (the rolling resistance). 
## Part 1 
What are the drag forces at ($v1km) (km/h) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is ($DA1) (m^2)). 
## Part 2 
What are the drag forces at ($v2km) (km/h) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is ($DA1) (m^2)) 
## Part 3 
What is the drag force at ($v1km) (km/h) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is ($DA2) (m^2)) 
## Part 4 
What is the drag force at ($v2km) (km/h) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is ($DA2) (m^2))
