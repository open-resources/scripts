# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($ml)-(kg) skydiver and a ($mh)-(kg) skydiver jump from an airplane at an altitude of ($d) (m), both falling in the pike position. Assume their cross-sectional areas are both ($A) (m^2) and calculate their terminal speeds. 
## Part 1 
How long will it take for the first skydiver with mass ($ml) (kg) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)? 
## Part 2 
How long will it take for the second skydiver with mass ($mh) (kg) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)?
