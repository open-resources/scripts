# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($ms) (g) squirrel with a cross-sectional area of ($A) (m^2) falls from a ($x)-(m)-high tree to the ground. Estimate its terminal speed. (Use the drag coefficient for a horizontal skydiver). 
## Part 1 
What will be the speed of a ($mp) (kg) person hitting the ground, assuming no drag contribution in such a short distance?
