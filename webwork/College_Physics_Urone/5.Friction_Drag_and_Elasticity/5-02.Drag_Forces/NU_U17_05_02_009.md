# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Stokes's law describes sedimentation of particles in liquids and can be used to determine viscosity. Particles in liquids achieve terminal speed quickly. One can measure the time it takes for a particle to fall a certain distance and then use Stokes's law to calculate the viscosity of the liquid. Suppose a steel ball bearing (density ($dense times 10^3) (kg/m^3), diameter ($dmm) (mm)) is dropped in a container of motor oil. It takes ($t) (s) to fall a distance of ($d) (m). Calculate the viscosity of the oil.
