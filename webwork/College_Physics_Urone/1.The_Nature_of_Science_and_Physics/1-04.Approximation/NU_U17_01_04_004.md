# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the approximate number of atoms in a bacterium. Assume that the average mass of an atom in the bacterium is ten times the mass of a hydrogen atom. (Hint: The mass of a hydrogen atom is on the order of (10^-27 , kg) and the mass of a bacterium is on the order of (10^-15, kg).)
