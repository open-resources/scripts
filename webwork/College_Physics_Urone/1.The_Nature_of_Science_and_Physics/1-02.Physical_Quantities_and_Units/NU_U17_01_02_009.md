# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
$PAR Tectonic plates are large segments of the Earth's crust that move slowly. Suppose that one such plate has an average speed of ($speed , cm/year). 
## Part 2 
What distance does it move in (1, s) at this speed? 
## Part 3 
What is its speed in kilometers per million years?
