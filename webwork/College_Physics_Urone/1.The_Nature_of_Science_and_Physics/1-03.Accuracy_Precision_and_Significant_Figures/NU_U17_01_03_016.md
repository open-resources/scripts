# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
When non-metric units were used in the United Kingdom, a unit of mass called the pound-mass (lbm) was employed, where (1, lbm = 0.4539, kg). 
## Part 1 
If there is an uncertainty of ($uncertainty , kg) in the pound-mass unit, what is its percent uncertainty? 
## Part 2 
Based on that percent uncertainty, what mass in pound-mass has an uncertainty of (1, kg) when converted to kilograms?
