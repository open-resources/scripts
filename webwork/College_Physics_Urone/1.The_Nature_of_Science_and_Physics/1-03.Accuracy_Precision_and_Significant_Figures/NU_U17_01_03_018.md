# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A car engine moves a piston with a circular cross section of ($diameter pm $uncertainty_diameter , cm) diameter a distance of ($distance pm $uncertainty_distance , cm) to compress the gas in the cylinder. 
## Part 1 
By what amount is the gas decreased in volume in cubic centimeters? 
## Part 2 
Find the uncertainty in this volume.
