# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A marathon runner completes a ($distance -km) course in ($hours , h), ($mins , min), and ($secs , s). There is an uncertainty of ($uncertainty_d , m) in the distance traveled and an uncertainty of (1 , s) in the elapsed time. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the percent uncertainty in the distance. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the uncertainty in the elapsed time. 
## Part 3 
What is the average speed in (m/s)? 
## Part 4 
What is the uncertainty in the average speed in (m/s)?
