# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The side lengths of a small rectangular box are measured to be ($length_1 pm $uncertainty_1 , cm), ($length_2 pm $uncertainty_2 , cm), and ($length_3 pm $uncertainty_3 , cm). Calculate the volume of the box and the uncertainty in the volume in (cubic centimeters).
