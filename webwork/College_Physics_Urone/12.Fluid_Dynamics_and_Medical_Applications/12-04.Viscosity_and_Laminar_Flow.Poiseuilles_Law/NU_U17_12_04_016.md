# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
When physicians diagnose arterial blockages, they quote the reduction in flow rate. Ifthe flow rate in an artery has been reduced to (10.0)(%) of its normal value by a bloodclot and the average pressure difference has increased by (20.0)(%), by what factor hasthe clot reduced the radius of the artery?
