# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An intravenous (IV) system having a needle of radius ($R) (mm) and length ($L) (cm) supplies saline solution to a patient whose blood is at a gauge pressure of ($p1) (mm Hg). 
## Part 1 
What pressure difference is created at a depth of ($ha) (m) in a saline solution, assuming its density is that of sea water? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the new flow rate if the height of the saline solution is decreased to (1.50) (m). 
## Part 3 
At what height would the direction of flow be reversed? This reversal can be a problem when patients stand up.
