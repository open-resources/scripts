# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The arterioles (small arteries) leading to an organ, constrict in order to decrease flow to the organ. To shut down an organ, blood flow is reduced naturally to ($percent)(%) of its original value. By what factor did the radii of the arterioles constrict? 
## Part 1 
Penguins do this when they stand on ice to reduce the blood flow to their feet.
