# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The pressure drop along a length of artery is ($P) (Pa), the radius is ($rmm) (mm), and the flow is laminar. The average speed of the blood is ($vmm) (mm/s). 
## Part 1 
What is the net force on the blood in this section of artery? 
## Part 2 
What is the power expended maintaining the flow?
