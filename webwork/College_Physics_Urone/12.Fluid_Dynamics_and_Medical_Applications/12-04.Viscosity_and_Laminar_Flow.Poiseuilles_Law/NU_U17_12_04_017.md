# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During a marathon race, a runner's blood flow increases to ($inc) times her resting rate. Her blood's viscosity has dropped to ($percent)(%) of its normal value, and the blood pressure difference across the circulatory system has increased by (50.0)(%). By what factor has the average radii of her blood vessels increased?
