# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Water supplied to a house by a water main has a pressure of ($pressure times 10^5) (N/m^2) early on a summer day when neighbourhood use is low. This pressure produces a flow of ($Qha) (L/min) through a garden hose. Later in the day, pressure at the exit of the water main and entrance to the house drops, and a flow of only ($Qh1a) (L/min) is obtained through the same hose. 
## Part 1 
What pressure is now being supplied to the house, assuming resistance is constant? 
## Part 2 
By what factor did the flow rate in the water main increase in order to cause this decrease in pressure delivered to the house? The pressure at the entrance of the water main is ($pressure3 times 10^5) (N/m^2), and the original flow rate was ($QmLmin) (L/min). 
## Part 3 
How many more users are there, assuming each would consume ($Qha) (L/min) in the morning and ($Qh1a) (L/min) in the afternoon?
