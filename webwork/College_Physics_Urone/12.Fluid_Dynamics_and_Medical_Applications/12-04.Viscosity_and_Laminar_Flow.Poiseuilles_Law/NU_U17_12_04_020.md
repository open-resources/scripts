# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of beingcarried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is ($QLmin) (L/min) through a ($l)-(m)-long, ($dcm)-(cm) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is ($pressure times 10^6  N/m^2). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the resistance of the hose. 
## Part 2 
What is the viscosity of the concrete, assuming the flow is laminar? 
## Part 3 
How much power is being supplied, assuming the point of use is at the same level as the pump? You may neglect the power supplied to increase the concrete's velocity.
