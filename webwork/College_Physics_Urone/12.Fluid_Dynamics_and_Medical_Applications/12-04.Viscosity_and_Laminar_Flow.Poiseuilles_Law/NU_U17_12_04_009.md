# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a blood vessel's radius is decreased to ($percent)(%) of its original value by plaque deposits and the body compensates by increasing the pressure difference along the vessel to keep the flow rate constant. 
## Part 1 
By what factor must the pressure difference increase?
