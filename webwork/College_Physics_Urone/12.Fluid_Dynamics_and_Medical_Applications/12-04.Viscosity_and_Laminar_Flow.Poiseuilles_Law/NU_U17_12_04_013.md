# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A layer of oil ($Lmm) (mm) thick is placed between two microscope slides. Researchers find that a force of ($Ff times 10^-4) (N) is required to glide one over the other at a speed of ($vcm) (cm/s) when their contact area is ($Acm) (cm^2). What is the oil's viscosity?
