# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A glucose solution being administered with an IV has a flow rate of ($Q) (cm^3)(/min). What will the new flow rate be if the glucose is replaced by whole blood having the same density but a viscosity ($n) times that of the glucose? All other factors remain constant.
