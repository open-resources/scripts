# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An oil gusher shoots crude oil ($x) (m) into the air through a pipe with a ($d)-(m) diameter. Neglecting air resistance but not the resistance of the pipe, and assuming laminar flow, calculate the pressure at the bottom of the ($h)-(m)-long vertical pipe. Take the density of the oil to be ($p) (kg/m^3) and its viscosity to be (1.00 N/m^2) (or (Pa) $\cdot$ (s)). Note that you must take into account the pressure due to the ($h)-(m) column of oil in the pipe.
