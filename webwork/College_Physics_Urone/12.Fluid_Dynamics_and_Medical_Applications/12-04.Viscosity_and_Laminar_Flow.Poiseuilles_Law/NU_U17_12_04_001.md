# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the retarding force due to the viscosity of the air layer between a cart and a level air track given the following informationâ€”the air temperature is (20^circC), the cart is moving at ($v) (m/s), its surface area is ($Aa times 10^-2) (m^2), and the thickness of the air layer is ($La times 10^-5) (m). 
## Part 1 
What is the ratio of this force to the weight of the ($m)-(kg) cart?
