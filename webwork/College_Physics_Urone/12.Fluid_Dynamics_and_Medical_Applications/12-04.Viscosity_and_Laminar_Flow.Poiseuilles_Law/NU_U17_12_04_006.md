# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Fluid originally flows through a tube at a rate of ($Q) (cm^3)(/s). To illustrate the sensitivity of flow rate to various factors, calculate the new flow rate for the following changes with all other factors remaining the same as in the original conditions. 
## Part 1 
Pressure difference increases by a factor of (1.50). 
## Part 2 
A new fluid with (3.00) times greater viscosity is substituted. 
## Part 3 
The tube is replaced by one having (4.00) times the length. 
## Part 4 
Another tube is used with a radius (0.100) times the original. 
## Part 5 
Yet another tube is substituted with a radius (0.100) times the original and half the length, and the pressure difference is increased by a factor of (1.50).
