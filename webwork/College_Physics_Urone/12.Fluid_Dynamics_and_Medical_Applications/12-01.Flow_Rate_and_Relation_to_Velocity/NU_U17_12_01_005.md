## Part 0 
The Huka Falls on the Waikato River is one of New Zealand's most visited natural tourist attractions. On average the river has a flow rate of about ($QLs1times 10^5) (L/s). At the gorge, the river narrows to ($wa) (m) wide and averages ($da) (m) deep. 
## Part 1 
What is the average speed of the river in the gorge? 
## Part 2 
What is the average speed of the water in the river downstream of the falls when it widens to ($wb) (m) and its depth increases to an average of ($db) (m)?
