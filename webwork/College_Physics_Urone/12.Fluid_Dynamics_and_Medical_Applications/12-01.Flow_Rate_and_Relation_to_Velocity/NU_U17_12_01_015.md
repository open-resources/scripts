# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Water emerges straight down from a faucet with a ($da)-(cm) diameter at a speed of ($vo) (m/s). Because of the construction of the faucet, there is no variation in speed across the stream. 
## Part 1 
What is the flow rate in (cm^3)(/s)? 
## Part 2 
What is the diameter of the stream ($x) (m) below the faucet?Neglect any effects due to surface tension.
