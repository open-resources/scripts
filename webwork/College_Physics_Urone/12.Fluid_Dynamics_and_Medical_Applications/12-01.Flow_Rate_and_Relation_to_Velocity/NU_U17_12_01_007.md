# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
As blood passes through the capillary bed in an organ, the capillaries join to form venules (small veins). If the blood speed increases by a factor of ($v) and the total cross-sectional area of the venules is ($A2) (cm^2), what is the total cross-sectional area of the capillaries feeding these venules? 
## Part 1 
How many capillaries are involved if their average diameter is (10.0 times 10^-6) (m)?
