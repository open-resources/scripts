# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The main uptake air duct of a forced air gas heater is ($d) (m) in diameter. What is the average speed of air in the duct if it carries a volume equal to that of the house's interior every ($min) (min)? 
## Part 1 
The inside volume of the house is equivalent to a rectangular solid ($w) (m) wide by ($l) (m) long by ($h) (m) high.
