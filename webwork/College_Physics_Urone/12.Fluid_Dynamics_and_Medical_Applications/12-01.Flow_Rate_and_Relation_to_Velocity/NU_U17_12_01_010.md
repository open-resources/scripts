# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The flow rate of blood through a ($rad times 10^-6) (m) radius capillary is ($Qa times 10^-9) (cm^3)(/s). 
## Part 1 
What is the speed of the blood flow? (This small speed allows time for diffusion of materials to and from the blood). 
## Part 2 
Assuming all the blood in the body passes through capillaries, how many of them must there be to carry a total flow of ($totalflow) (cm^3)(/s)? 
## Part 3 
(The large number obtained is an overestimate, but it is still reasonable).
