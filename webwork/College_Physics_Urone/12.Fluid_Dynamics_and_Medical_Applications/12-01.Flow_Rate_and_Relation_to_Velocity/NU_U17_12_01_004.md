# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Blood is flowing through an artery of radius ($rmm) (mm) at a rate of ($v) (cm/s). 
## Part 1 
Determine the flow rate that passes through the artery in a period of ($t) (s). 
## Part 2 
Determine the volume that passes through the artery in a period of ($t) (s).
