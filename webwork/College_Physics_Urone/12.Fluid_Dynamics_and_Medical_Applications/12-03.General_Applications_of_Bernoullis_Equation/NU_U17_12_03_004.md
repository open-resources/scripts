# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A sump pump (used to drain water from the basement of houses built below the watertable) is draining a flooded basement at the rate of ($QLs) (L/s), with an output pressure of ($P1p times 10^5) (N/m^2). 
## Part 1 
The water enters a hose with a ($d1)-(cm) inside diameter and rises ($ha) (m) above the pump. What is its pressure at this point? 
## Part 2 
The hose goes over the foundation wall, losing (0.500) (m) in height, and widens to ($d2) (cm) in diameter. What is the pressure now? You may neglect frictional losses in both parts of the problem.
