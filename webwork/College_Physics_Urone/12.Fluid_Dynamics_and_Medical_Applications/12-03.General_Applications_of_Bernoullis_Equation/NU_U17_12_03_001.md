# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Hoover Dam on the Colorado River is the highest dam in the United States at (221) (m), with an output of (1300) (MW). The dam generates electricity with water taken from a depth of ($h) (m) and an average flow rate of ($Q) (m^3)(/s). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the power in this flow. 
## Part 2 
What is the ratio of this power to the facility's average of (680) (MW)?
