# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The left ventricle of a resting adult's heart pumps blood at a flow rate of ($Q) (cm^3)(/s), increasing its pressure by ($PmmHg) (mm Hg), its speed from zero to ($vcm) (cm/s), and its height by ($hcm) (cm). (All numbers are averaged over the entire heartbeat). Calculate the total power output of the left ventricle. Note that most of the power is used to increase blood pressure.
