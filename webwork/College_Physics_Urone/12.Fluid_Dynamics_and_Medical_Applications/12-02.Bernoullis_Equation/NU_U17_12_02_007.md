# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the pressure drop due to the Bernoulli effect as water goes into a ($d2)-(cm)-diameter nozzle from a ($d1)-(cm)-diameter fire hose while carrying a flow of ($QLs) (L/s)? 
## Part 1 
To what maximum height above the nozzle can this water rise? (The actual height will be significantly smaller due to air resistance).
