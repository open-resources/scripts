# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the approximate force on a square meter of sail, given the horizontal velocity of the wind is ($v2) (m/s) parallel to its front surface and ($v1) (m/s) along its back surface. Take the density of air to be ($p) (kg/m^3). 
## Part 1 
The calculation, based on Bernoulli's principle, is approximate due to the effects of turbulence.
