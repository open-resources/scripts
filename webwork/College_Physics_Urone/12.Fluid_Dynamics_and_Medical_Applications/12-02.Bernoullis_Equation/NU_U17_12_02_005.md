# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Every few years, winds in Boulder, Colorado, attain sustained speeds of ($v2) (m/s) when the jet stream descends during early spring. Approximately what is the force due to the Bernoulli effect on a roof having an area of ($A) (m^2)? Typical air density in Boulder is ($p) (kg/m^3), and the corresponding atmospheric pressure is ($pressure times 10^4) (N/m^2). (Bernoulli's principle assumes laminar flow; using the principle here produces only an approximate result, because there is significant turbulence).
