# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of beingcarried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is ($QLmin) (L/min) through a ($l)-(m)-long, ($dcm)-(cm) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is ($pressure times 10^6) (N/m^2). Verify that the flow of concrete is laminar taking concrete's viscosity to be ($n) (Pa) $\cdot$ (s), and given its density is ($density) (N/m^2).
