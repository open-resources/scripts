# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Gasoline is piped underground from refineries to major users. The flow rate is (3.00 times 10^-2) (m^3)(/s) (about (500) (gal/min)), the viscosity of gasoline is (1.00 times 10^-3) (Pa) $\cdot$ (s), and its density is ($p) (kg/m^3). 
## Part 1 
What minimum diameter must the pipe have if the Reynolds number is to be less than (2000)? 
## Part 2 
What pressure difference must be maintained along each kilometer of the pipe to maintain this flow rate?
