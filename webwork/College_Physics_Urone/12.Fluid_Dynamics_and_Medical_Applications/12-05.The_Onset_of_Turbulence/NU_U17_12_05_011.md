# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Unreasonable Results: A fairly large garden hose has an internal radius of ($rcm) (m) and a length of ($l) (m). The nozzleless horizontal hose is attached to a faucet, and it delivers ($QLs) (L/s). 
## Part 1 
What water pressure is supplied by the faucet? 
## Part 2 
What is the Reynolds number for the given flow? Take the viscosity of water as (1.002 times 10^-3) (mPa) $\cdot$ (s).
