# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A fire hose has an inside diameter of ($dcmhose) (cm). Suppose such a hose carries a flow of ($QLs) (L/s) starting at a gauge pressure of (1.62 times 10^6 N/m^2). The hose goes ($h) (m) up a ladder to a nozzle having an inside diameter of ($dcmnozzle) (cm). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the Reynolds numbers for flow in the fire hose to show that the flow must be turbulent. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the Reynolds numbers for flow in the nozzle to show that the flow must be turbulent.
