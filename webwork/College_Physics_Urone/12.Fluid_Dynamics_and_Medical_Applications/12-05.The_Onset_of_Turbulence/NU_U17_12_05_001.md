# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Verify that the flow of oil is laminar (barely) for an oil gusher that shoots crude oil($y) (m) into the air through a pipe with a ($d)-(m) diameter. The vertical pipe is ($l) (m) long. Take the density of the oil to be ($p kg/m^3) and its viscosity to be (1.00) (Pa) $\cdot$ (s).
