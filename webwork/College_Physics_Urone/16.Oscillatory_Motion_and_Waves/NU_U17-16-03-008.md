# {{ params.vars.title }}![Child in Harness](NU_U17-16-03-008.png)

## Part 0 
A child bounces in a harness suspended from a door frame by a spring constant. 
## Part 1 
 If the spring stretches ($stretch1) (m) while supporting an ($mass)-(kg) child, what is its spring constant? 
## Part 2 
What is the time for one complete bounce of this child? 
## Part 3 
What is the child's maximum velocity if the amplitude of her bounce is ($Amplitude) (m)?
