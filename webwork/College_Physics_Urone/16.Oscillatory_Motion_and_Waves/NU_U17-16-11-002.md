# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The low-frequency speaker of a stereo set has a surface area of ($SA) (m^2) and produces (1) (W)  of acoustical power. 
## Part 1 
What is the intensity at the speaker? 
## Part 2 
 If the speaker projects sound uniformly in all directions, at what distance from the speaker is the intensity equal to ($intensity) (W/m^2)?
