# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
One type of BB gun uses a spring-driven plunger to blow the BB from its barrel. 
## Part 1 
 Calculate the force constant of its plunger's spring if you must compress it ($x) (m) to drive the ($mass) (kg) plunger to a top speed of ($v) (m/s). 
## Part 2 
What force must be exerted to compress the spring?
