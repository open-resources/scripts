# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
 A novelty clock has a ($mass)-(kg) mass object bouncing on a spring that has a force constant of ($force) (N/m). What is the maximum velocity of the object if the object bounces ($height) (m) above and below its equilibrium position? 
## Part 1 
How many joules of kinetic energy does the object have at its maximum velocity?
