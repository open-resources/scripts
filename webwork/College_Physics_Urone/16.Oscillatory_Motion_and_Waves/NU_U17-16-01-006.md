# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A spring has a length of ($length1) (m) when a ($mass1) (kg) mass hangs from it, and a length of ($length2) (m) when a ($mass2) (kg) mass hangs from it. 
## Part 1 
 What is the force constant of the spring? 
## Part 2 
 What is the unloaded length of the spring?
