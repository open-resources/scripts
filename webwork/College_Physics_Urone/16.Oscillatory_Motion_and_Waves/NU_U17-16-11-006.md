# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have a device that extracts energy from ocean breakers in direct proportion to their intensity. If the device produces ($power) (kW) of power on a day when the breakers are ($height) (m) high, how much will it produce when they are ($height2) (m) high?
