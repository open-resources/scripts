# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An object is attached to a spring at its unloaded rest position and allowed to bounce up and down. 
## Part 1 
 If the spring has a force constant of ($force) (N/m) and a ($mass) (kg) mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations. 
## Part 2 
Find the maximum velocity.
