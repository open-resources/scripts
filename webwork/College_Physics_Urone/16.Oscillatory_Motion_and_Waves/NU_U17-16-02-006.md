# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Engineering Application: Each cylinder of an engine makes a sharp sound every other revolution of the engine. 
## Part 1 
(a) How fast is a race car going if its eight-cylinder engine emits a sound of frequency ($fq) (Hz), given that the engine makes ($rev) revolutions per kilometer? 
## Part 2 
(b) At how many revolutions per minute is the engine rotating?
