# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The length of nylon rope from which a mountain climber is suspended has a force constant of ($force ) (N/m). 
## Part 1 
What is the frequency at which he bounces, given his mass plus and the mass of his equipment are ($mass) (kg)? 
## Part 2 
How much would this rope stretch to break the climber's fall if he free-falls ($fall) (m) before the rope runs out of slack?
