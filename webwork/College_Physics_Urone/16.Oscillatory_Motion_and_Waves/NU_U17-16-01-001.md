# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Fish are hung on a spring scale to determine their mass. 
## Part 1 
 What is the force constant of the spring in such a scale if it the spring stretches ($x) (cm) for a ($mass) (kg) load? 
## Part 2 
What is the mass of a fish that stretches the spring ($x2) (cm)? 
## Part 3 
How far apart are the half-kilogram marks on the scale?
