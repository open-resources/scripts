# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
It is weigh-in time for the local under-(85)-(kg) rugby team. The bathroom scale used to assess eligibility can be described by Hooke's law and is depressed ($x) (cm) by its maximum load of ($mass) (kg). 
## Part 1 
 What is the spring's effective spring constant? 
## Part 2 
A player stands on the scales and depresses it by ($x2) (cm). What is that players mass in (kg)?
