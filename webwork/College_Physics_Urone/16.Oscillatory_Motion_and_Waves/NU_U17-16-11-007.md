# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A photovoltaic array of solar cells is ($percent)(%) efficient in converting incident solar energy into electricity. 
## Part 1 
 If the average intensity of sunlight on one day is ($intensity)      (W/m^2), what area should your array have to produce electrical energy at the rate of ($power) (W)? 
## Part 2 
What is the maximum cost of the array if it must pay for itself in two years of operation averaging (10.0) hours at per day? Assume that it earns money at the rate of (9.00) cents per kilowatt-hour. 
## Part 3
