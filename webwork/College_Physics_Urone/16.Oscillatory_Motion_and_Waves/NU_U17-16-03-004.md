# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($mass) (kg) object attached to a spring initially oscillates with a period of ($T1) (s). 
## Part 1 
(a) What increase in mass is required such that the new period is no greater than ($T2) (s)? 
## Part 2 
(b) What is this increase in mass, expressed as a percentage of the initial mass?
