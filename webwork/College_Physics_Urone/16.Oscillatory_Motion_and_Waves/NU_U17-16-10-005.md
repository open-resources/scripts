# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A wave traveling on a SlinkyÂ® that is stretched to ($distance) (m) takes ($time) (s) to travel the length of the Slinky and back again. 
## Part 1 
What is the speed of the wave? 
## Part 2 
Using the same Slinky stretched to the same length, a standing wave is created which consists of three antinodes and four nodes. At what frequency must the Slinky be oscillating?
