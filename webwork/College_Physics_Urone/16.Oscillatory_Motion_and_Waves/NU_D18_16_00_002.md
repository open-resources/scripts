# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A spring that has stiffness constant (224) N/m rests at its equilibrium length of (16) cm. You gently push on the end of the spring, compressing it to a length of (14) cm, where you hold the spring at rest. Determine the magnitude of the force that you need to hold the spring at its new length.$BR$BRans_rule(40) N$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$F"));b) A spring that has stiffness constant (224) N/m rests at its equilibrium length of (22) cm.
