# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
During a training exercise, Alice runs back and forth between two spots that are ($a) m apart. She keeps up a constant speed of ($b) m/s, and we can assume that the time she takes to turn at the endpoints of her motion is negligible.$BR$BRa) Determine the period of Alice's motion.$BR$BRans_rule(40) s$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$T"));b) Determine the frequency of Alice's motion.$BR$BRans_rule(40) Hz$BR$BR
