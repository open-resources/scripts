# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Engineering Application: A suspension bridge oscillates with an effective force constant of ($force times 10^8) (N/m). 
## Part 1 
How much energy is needed to make it oscillate with an amplitude of ($distance) (m)? 
## Part 2 
If soldiers march across the bridge with a cadence equal to the bridge's natural frequency and impart ($energy times 10^4) (J) of energy each second, how long does it take for the bridge's oscillations to go from ($distance) (m) to ($distance2) (m) amplitude?
