# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A diver on a diving board is undergoing simple harmonic motion. Her mass is ($mass) (kg) and the period of her motion is ($T) (s). The next diver is a male whose period of simple harmonic oscillation is ($T2) (s). What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?
