# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A spring rests at its equilibrium length of ($a) cm. You compress the spring to a new length of ($b) cm, holding the spring at rest at its new length. You do ($W) J of work on the spring during the compression process. Friction, air resistance, and other dissipative forces can be neglected, and the motion takes place in a horizontal plane.$BR$BRa) Determine the elastic potential energy stored in the spring.$BR$BRans_rule(40) J$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$W"));b) Determine the stiffness constant of the spring.$BR$BRans_rule(40) N/m$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$k"));c) Determine the magnitude of the force you exert to hold the spring at rest at its new compressed length.$BR$BRans_rule(40) N$BR$BR
