# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The springs of a pickup truck act like a single spring with a force constant of ($constant times 10^5) (N/m). 
## Part 1 
 By how much will the truck be depressed by its maximum load of ($mass) (kg)? 
## Part 2 
If the pickup truck has four identical springs, what is the force constant of each?
