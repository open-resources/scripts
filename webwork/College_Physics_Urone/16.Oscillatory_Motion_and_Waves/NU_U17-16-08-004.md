# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have a ($mass)-(kg) object on a horizontal surface connected to a spring that has a force constant of ($force) (N/m). There is simple friction between the object and surface with a static coefficient of friction ($sfriction). 
## Part 1 
How far can the spring be stretched without moving the mass? 
## Part 2 
If the object is set into oscillation with an amplitude twice the distance found in part (a), and the kinetic coefficient of friction is ($kfriction) , what total distance does it travel before stopping? Assume it starts at the maximum amplitude.
