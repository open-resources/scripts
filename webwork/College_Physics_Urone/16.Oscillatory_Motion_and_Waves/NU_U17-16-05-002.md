# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Engineering Application: Near the top of the Citigroup Center building in New York City, there is an object with mass of (4.00 times 10^5) (kg) on springs that have adjustable force constants. Its function is to dampen wind-driven oscillations of the building by oscillating at the same frequency as the building is being drivenâ€”the driving force is transferred to the object, which oscillates instead of the entire building. 
## Part 1 
 Which effective stiffness constant should the springs have to make the object oscillate with a period of ($period) (s)? 
## Part 2 
How much energy is stored in the springs for a ($length)-(m) displacement from equilibrium?
