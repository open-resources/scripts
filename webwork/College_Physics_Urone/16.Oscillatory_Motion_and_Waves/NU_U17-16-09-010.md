## Part 0 
Seismographs measure the arrival times of earthquakes with a precision of (0.100) (s). To get the distance to the epicenter of the quake, they compare the arrival times of S- and P-waves, which travel at different speeds. If S- and P-waves travel at ($S) (km/s) and ($P) (km/s), respectively, in the region considered, how precisely can the distance to the source of the earthquake be determined?
