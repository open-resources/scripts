# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Two manned satellites approach one another at a relative speed of ($v , m/s), intending to dock. The first has a mass of ($m1 times 10^3 , kg), and the second a mass of ($m2 times 10^3 , kg). If the two satellites collide elastically rather than dock,what is their final relative velocity?
