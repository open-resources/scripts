# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m1 -kg) ice hockey goalie, originally at rest, catches a ($m2 -kg) hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of ($v2 , m/s). Suppose the goalie and the ice puck have an elastic collision and the puck is reflected back in the direction from which it came. 
## Part 1 
What would the final velocity of the puck be in this case? 
## Part 2 
What would the final velocity of the goalie be in this case?
