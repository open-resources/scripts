# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($m1a)-kg squid initially at rest ejects ($m2)-kg of fluid with a velocity of ($v2) m/s. What is the recoil velocity of the squid if the ejection is done in ($t) s and there is a ($f)-N frictional force opposing the squid's movement? 
## Part 2 
How much energy is lost to work done against friction?
