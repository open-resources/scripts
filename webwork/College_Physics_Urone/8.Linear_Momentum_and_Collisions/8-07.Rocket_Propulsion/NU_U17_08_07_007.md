# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A fire extinguisher-toy wagon starts from rest and attains a final velocity of ($v , m/s). The total mass is initially ($mo , kg) and is ($m , kg) after the extinguisher is fired. Calculate the average exhaust velocity of the gases expelled from the extinguisher.
