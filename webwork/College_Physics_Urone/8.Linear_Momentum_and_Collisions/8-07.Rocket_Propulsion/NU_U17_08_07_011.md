# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Squids have been reported to jump from the ocean and travel ($R , m) (measured horizontally) before re-entering the water. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the initial speed of the squid if it leaves the water at an angle of ($theta ^circ), assuming negligible lift from the air and negligible air resistance. 
## Part 2 
The squid propels itself by squirting water. What fraction of its mass would it have to eject in order to achieve the speed found in the previous part? The water is ejected at ($ve , m/s); gravitational force and friction are neglected.
