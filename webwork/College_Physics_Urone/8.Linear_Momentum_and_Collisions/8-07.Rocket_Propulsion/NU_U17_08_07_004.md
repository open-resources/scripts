# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Ion-propulsion rockets have been proposed for use in space. They employ atomic ionization techniques and nuclear energy sources to produce extremely high exhaust velocities, perhaps as great as ($va times 10^6 , m/s). These techniques allow a much more favorable payload-to-fuel ratio. To illustrate this fact: 
## Part 1 
Calculate the increase in velocity of a ($mo -kg) space probe that expels only ($m1 -kg) of its mass at the given exhaust velocity. 
## Part 2 
These engines are usually designed to produce a very small thrust for a very long timeâ€” the type of engine that might be useful on a trip to the outer planets, for example. Calculate the acceleration of such an engine if it expels ($mta times 10^-6 , kg/s) at the given velocity, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is negligible.
