<b>Professional Application:</b> Calculate the maximum rate at which a rocket can expel gases if its acceleration cannot exceed seven times that of gravity. The mass of the rocket just as it runs out of fuel is ($m , kg), and its exhaust velocity is ($va times 10^3 , m/s). Assume that the acceleration of gravity is the same as on Earth's surface ($g , m/s^2).
