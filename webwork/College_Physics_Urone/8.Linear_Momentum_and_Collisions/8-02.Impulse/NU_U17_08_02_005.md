# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Suppose a child drives a bumper car head on into the siderail, which exerts a force of ($F , N) on the car for ($t , s). 
## Part 1 
What impulse is imparted by this force? 
## Part 2 
Find the final velocity of the bumper car if its initial velocity was ($vib , m/s) and the car plus driver have a mass of ($m , kg). You may neglect friction between the car and floor.
