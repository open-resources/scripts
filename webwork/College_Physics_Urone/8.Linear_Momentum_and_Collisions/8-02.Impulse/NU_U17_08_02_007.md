# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> A ($m -kg) person is riding in a car moving at ($vo , m/s) when the car runs into a bridge abutment. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the average force on the person if he is stopped by a padded dashboard that compresses an average of ($xacm , cm). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the average force on the person if he is stopped by an air bag that compresses an average of ($xbcm , cm).
