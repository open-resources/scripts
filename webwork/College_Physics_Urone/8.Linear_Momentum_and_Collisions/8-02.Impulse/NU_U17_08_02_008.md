# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Military rifles have a mechanism for reducing the recoilforces of the gun on the person firing it. An internal part recoils over a relatively largedistance and is stopped by damping mechanisms in the gun. The larger distancereduces the average force needed to stop the internal part. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the recoil velocity of a ($m1 -kg) plunger that directly interacts with a ($m2 -kg) bullet fired at ($v2l , m/s) from the gun. 
## Part 2 
If this part is stopped over a distance of ($xcm , cm), what average force is exerted upon it by the gun? 
## Part 3 
Compare this to the force exerted on the gun if the bullet is accelerated to its velocity in ($tms , ms).
