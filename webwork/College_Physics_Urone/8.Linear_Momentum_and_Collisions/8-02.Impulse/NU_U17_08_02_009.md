# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A cruise ship with a mass of ($ma times 10^7 , kg) strikes a pier at a speed of ($vo , m/s). It comes to rest ($x , m) later, damaging the ship, the pier, and the tugboat captain's finances. Calculate the average force exerted on the pier using the concept of impulse.
