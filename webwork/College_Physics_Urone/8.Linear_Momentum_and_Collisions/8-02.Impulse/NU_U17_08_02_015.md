# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
When serving a tennis ball, a player hits the ball when its velocity is zero (at thehighest point of a vertical toss). The racquet exerts a force of ($F , N) on the ball for ($tms , ms), giving it a final velocity of ($v , m/s). Using these data, find the mass of the ball.
