# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ball with an initial velocity of ($v , m/s) moves at an angle (60 ^circ) above the positive (x -)direction. The ball hits a vertical wall and bounces off so that it is moving (60 ^circ) above the negative (x -)direction with the same speed. What is the magnitude of the impulse delivered by the wall?
