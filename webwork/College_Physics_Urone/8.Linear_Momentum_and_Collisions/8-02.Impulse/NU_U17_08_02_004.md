# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> A professional boxer hits his opponent with a ($F -N) horizontal blow that lasts for ($t , s). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the impulse imparted by this blow. 
## Part 2 
What is the opponent's final velocity, if his mass is ($mb , kg)  and he is motionless in midair when struck near his center of mass? 
## Part 3 
Calculate the recoil velocity of the opponent's ($mc -kg) head if hit in this manner, assuming the head does not initially transfer significant momentum to the boxer's body.
