# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m1 -kg) cannon is mounted so that it can recoil only in the horizontal direction. 
## Part 1 
Calculate its recoil velocity when it fires a ($m2 -kg) shell at ($v2 , m/s) at an angle of ($theta2 ^circ) above the horizontal. 
## Part 2 
What is the kinetic energy of the cannon? This energy is dissipated as heat transfer in shock absorbers that stop its recoil.
