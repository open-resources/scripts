# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Ernest Rutherford (the first New Zealander to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry) demonstrated that nuclei were very small and dense by scattering helium-4 nuclei, ( ^4 He), from gold-197 nuclei, ( ^197 Au). The energy of the incoming helium nucleus was (8.00 times 10^-13 , J), and the masses of the helium and gold nuclei were (6.68 times 10^-27 , kg) and (3.29 times 10^-25 , kg), respectively (note that their mass ratio is 4 to 197). 
## Part 1 
If a helium nucleus scatters to an angle of ($theta1 ^circ) during an elastic collision with a gold nucleus, determine the angle at which the gold nucleus itself scatters. 
## Part 2 
What is the final kinetic energy of the helium nucleus?
