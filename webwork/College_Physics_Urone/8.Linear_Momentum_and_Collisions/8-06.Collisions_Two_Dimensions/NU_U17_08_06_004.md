# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> A ($m1 -kg) bowling ball moving at ($v1 , m/s) collides with a ($m2 -kg) bowling pin, which is scattered at an angle of ($phi ^circ) to the initial direction of the bowling ball and with a speed of ($v22 , m/s). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the final velocity (magnitude and direction) of the bowling ball. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the ratio of the kinetic energy before and after the collision.
