# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Two identical pucks collide on an air hockey table. One puck was originally at rest. 
## Part 1 
If the incoming puck has a speed of ($v1 , m/s) and scatters to an angle of ($phi ^circ), what is the magnitude of the velocity of the second puck? (You may use the result that (theta _1 - theta _2 = 90^circ) for elastic collisions of objects that have identical masses.)
