# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($mh -kg) ice hockey player hits a ($mp -kg) puck, giving the puck a velocity of ($vp , m/s). If both are initially at rest and if the ice is frictionless, how far backwards does the player recoil in the time it takes the puck to reach the goal ($dp , m) away?
