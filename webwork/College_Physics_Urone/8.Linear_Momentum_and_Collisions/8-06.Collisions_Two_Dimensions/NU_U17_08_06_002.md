# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($mlight -kg) object is slid on a frictionless surface into a dark room, where it strikes an initially stationary object with mass of ($mheavy , kg). The ($mlight -kg) object emerges from the room at an angle of ($degreelight ^circ) with its incoming direction. The speed of the ($mlight -kg) object is originally ($vlightbefore , m/s) and is ($vlightafter , m/s) after the collision. 
## Part 1 
Confirm that momentum is conserved in both the (x) and (y) directions. 
## Part 2 
Confirm that the collision is elastic.
