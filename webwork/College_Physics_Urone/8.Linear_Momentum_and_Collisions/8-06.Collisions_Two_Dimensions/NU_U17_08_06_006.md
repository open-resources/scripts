# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Two cars collide at an icy intersection and stick together afterward. The first car has a mass of ($m1 , kg) and is approaching at ($v1 , m/s) due south. The second car has a mass of ($m2 , kg) and is approaching at ($v2 , m/s) due west. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the final velocity direction of the cars. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the final speed of the cars. 
## Part 3 
How much kinetic energy is lost in the collision? (This energy goes into deformation of the cars.)
