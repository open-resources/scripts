# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the mass of a large ship that has a momentum of ($momentum_ship times 10^9 , kg cdot m/s) when the ship is moving at a speed of ($velocity_ship , km/h)? 
## Part 1 
Compare the ship's momentum to the momentum of a ($mass_shellSI ,kg) artillery shell fired at a speed of ($velocity_shellSI , m/s).
