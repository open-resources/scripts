# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the momentum of a ($mass_elephantSI , kg) elephant charging a hunter at a speed of ($velocity_elephantSI , m/s). 
## Part 1 
Compare the elephant's momentum to the momentum of a ($mass_bulletSI , kg) tranquilizer dart fired at a speed of ($velocity_bulletSI , m/s). 
## Part 2 
What is the momentum of the ($mass_hunterSI , kg) hunter running at ($velocity_hunterSI , m/s) after missing the elephant?
