# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m -kg) billiard ball that is moving at ($vi , m/s) strikes the bumper of a pool table and bounces straight back at ($vf , m/s). The collision lasts ($t , s). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the average force exerted on the ball by the bumper. 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy in joules is lost during the collision? 
## Part 3 
What percent of the original energy is left?
