# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During a circus act, an elderly performer thrills the crowd by catching a cannon ballshot at him. The cannon ball has a mass of ($m1 , kg) and the horizontal component of its velocity is ($v1 , m/s) when the ($m2 -kg) performer catches it. If the performer is on nearly frictionless roller skates, what is his recoil velocity?
