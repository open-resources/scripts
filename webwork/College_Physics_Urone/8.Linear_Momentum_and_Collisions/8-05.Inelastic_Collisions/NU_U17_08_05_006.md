# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> A ($m1a times 10^4 , kg) freight car is coasting at ($v1 , m/s) with negligible friction under a hopper that dumps ($m2a times 10^5 , kg) of scrap metal into it. 
## Part 1 
What is the final velocity of the loaded freight car? 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy is lost?
