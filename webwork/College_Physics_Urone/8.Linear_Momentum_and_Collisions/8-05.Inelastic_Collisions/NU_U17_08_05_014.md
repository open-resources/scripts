# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During an ice skating performance, an initially motionless ($m1 -kg) clown throws a fake barbell away. The clown's ice skates allow her to recoil frictionlessly. If the clown recoils with a velocity of ($v1 , m/s) and the barbell is thrown with a velocity of ($v2 , m/s) what is the mass of the barbell? 
## Part 1 
How much kinetic energy is gained by this maneuver?
