# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During an ice show, a ($m1 -kg) skater leaps into the air and is caught by an initially stationary ($m2 -kg) skater. 
## Part 1 
What is their final velocity assuming negligible friction and that the ($m1 -kg) skater's original horizontal velocity is ($v1 , m/s)? 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy is lost?
