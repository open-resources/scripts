# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Two manned satellites approaching one another, at a relative speed of ($v2 , m/s), intending to dock. The first has a mass of ($m1a times 10^3 , kg), and the second a mass of ($m2a times 10^3 , kg). 
## Part 1 
Take the direction in which the second satellite was initially travelling as positive. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the final velocity (after docking) by using the frame of reference in which the first satellite was originally at rest. 
## Part 3 
What is the loss of kinetic energy in this inelastic collision? 
## Part 4 
Repeat part (a) by using the frame of reference in which the second satellite was originally at rest. 
## Part 5 
Repeat part (b) by using the frame of reference in which the second satellite was originally at rest. Explain why the change in velocity is different in the two frames, whereas the change in kinetic energy is the same in both.
