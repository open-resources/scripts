# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> The Moon's craters are remnants of meteorite collisions. Suppose a fairly large asteroid that has a mass of ($mai times 10^12 , kg) (about a kilometer across) strikes the Moon at a speed of  ($vakm , km/s). 
## Part 1 
At what speed does the Moon recoil after the perfectly inelastic collision, given that the mass of the Moon is (7.36 times 10^22 , kg)? 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy is lost in the collision? Such an event may have been observed by medieval English monks who reported observing a red glow and subsequent haze about the Moon.
