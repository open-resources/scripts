# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> Space probes may be separated from their launchers by exploding bolts. (They bolt away from one another.) 
## Part 1 
Suppose a ($m1 -kg) satellite uses this method to separate from the ($m2 -kg) remains of its launcher, and that ($KE , J) ofkinetic energy is supplied to the two parts. 
## Part 2 
What is the initial velocity of the satellite using the frame of reference in which both objects were at rest before separation? 
## Part 3 
What is the initial velocity of the launcher?
