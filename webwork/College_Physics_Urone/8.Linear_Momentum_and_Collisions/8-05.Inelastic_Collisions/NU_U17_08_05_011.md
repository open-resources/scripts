<b>Professional Application:</b> Two football players collide head-on in midair while trying to catch a thrown football. The first player is ($m1 , kg) and has an initial velocity of ($v1 , m/s), while the second player is ($m2 , kg) and has an initial velocity of ($v2 , m/s). What is their velocity just after impact if they cling together?
