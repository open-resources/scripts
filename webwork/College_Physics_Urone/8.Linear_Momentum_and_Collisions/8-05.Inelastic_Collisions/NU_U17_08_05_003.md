# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint</b>. 
## Part 1 
<b>Professional Application:</b> A ($m1 -kg) football player running at ($v1 , m/s) catches a ($m2 -kg) football having a speed of ($v2 , m/s). Calculate: 
## Part 2 
the final velocity if the ball and player are going in the same direction and 
## Part 3 
the loss of kinetic energy in this case. 
## Part 4 
Repeat part (a) for the situation in which the ball and the player are going in opposite directions. 
## Part 5 
Repeat part (b) for the situation in which the ball and the player are going in opposite directions. Might the loss of kinetic energy be related to how much it hurts to catch the pass?
