# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m2 -kg) bullet is accelerated from rest to a speed of ($v2 , m/s) in a ($m1 -kg) rifle. The pain of the rifle's kick is much worse if you hold the gun loosely a few centimetres from your shoulder rather than holding it tightly against your shoulder. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the recoil velocity of the rifle if it is held loosely away from the shoulder. 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy does the rifle gain? 
## Part 3 
What is the recoil velocity if the rifle is held tightly against the shoulder, making the effective mass ($m1c , kg)? 
## Part 4 
How much kinetic energy is transferred to the rifle-shoulder combination? The pain is related to the amount of kinetic energy, which is significantly less in this latter situation.
