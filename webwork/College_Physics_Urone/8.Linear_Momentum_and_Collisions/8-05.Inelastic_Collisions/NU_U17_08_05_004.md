# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A battleship that is ($m2a times 10^7 , kg) and is originally at rest fires a ($m1 -kg) artillery shell horizontally with a velocity of ($v1 , m/s). 
## Part 1 
If the shell is fired straight aft (toward the rear of the ship), there will be negligible friction opposing the ship's recoil. Calculate its recoil velocity. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the increase in internal kinetic energy (that is, for the ship and the shell). This energy is less than the energy released by the gun powderâ€” significant heat transfer occurs.
