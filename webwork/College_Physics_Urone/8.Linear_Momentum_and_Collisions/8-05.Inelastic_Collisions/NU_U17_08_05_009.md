# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Professional Application:</b> One of the waste products of a nuclear reactor is plutonium-239, (^239 Pu). This nucleus is radioactive and decays by splitting into a helium-4 nucleus, (^4 He), and a uranium-235 nucleus, (^235 U), the latter of which is also radioactive and will itself decay some time later. The energy emitted in the plutonium decay is (8.40 times 10^-13 , J) and is entirely converted to kinetic energy of the helium and uranium nuclei. The mass of the helium nucleus is (6.68 times 10^-27 , kg), while that of the uranium is (3.92 times 10^-25 , kg) (note that the ratio of the masses is 4 to 235). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the speed of the helium nucleus, assuming the plutonium nucleus is originally at rest. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the speed of the uranium nucleus, assuming the plutonium nucleus is originally at rest. 
## Part 3 
How much kinetic energy does the helium nucleus carry away? 
## Part 4 
How much kinetic energy does the uranium nucleus carry away?
