<b>Professional Application:</b> Train cars are coupled together by being bumped into one another. Suppose two loaded train cars are moving toward one another, the first having a mass of ($m1 , ! 000 , kg) and a velocity of ($v1 , m/s), and the second having a mass of ($m2 , ! 000 , kg) and a velocity of ($v2 , m/s). (The minus indicates direction of motion.) What is their final velocity?
