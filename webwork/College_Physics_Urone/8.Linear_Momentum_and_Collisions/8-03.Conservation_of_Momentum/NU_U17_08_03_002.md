# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a clay model of a koala bear has a mass of ($m1 , kg) and slides on ice at a speed of ($v1 , m/s). It runs into another clay model, which is initially motionless and has a mass of ($m2 , kg). Both being soft clay, they naturally stick together. What is their final velocity?
