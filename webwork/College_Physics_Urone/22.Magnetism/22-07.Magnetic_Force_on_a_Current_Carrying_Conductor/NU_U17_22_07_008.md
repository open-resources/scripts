# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($length , (m) long section of cable carrying current to a car starter motor makes an angle of ($angle^circ) with the Earth's ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T) field. What is the current when the wire experiences a force of ($force) (times 10^-3 , (N)? 
## Part 2 
If you run the wire between the poles of a strong horseshoe magnet, subjecting ($lengthb , (cm) of it to a ($fieldb , (T) field, what force is exerted on this segment of wire?
