# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the angle between a wire carrying an ($current , (A) current and the ($strength , (T) field it is in if ($length , (cm) of the wire experiences a magnetic force of ($force , (N)? 
## Part 2 
What is the force on the wire if it is rotated to make an angle of (90^circ) with the field?
