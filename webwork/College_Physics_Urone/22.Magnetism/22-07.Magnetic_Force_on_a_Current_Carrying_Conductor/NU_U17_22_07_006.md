# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What force is exerted on the water in an MHD drive utilizing a ($diameter , (cm) diameter tube, if ($current , (A) current is passed across the tube that is perpendicular to a ($strength , (T) magnetic field? (The relatively small size of this force indicates the need for very large currents and magnetic fields to make practical MHD drives.)
