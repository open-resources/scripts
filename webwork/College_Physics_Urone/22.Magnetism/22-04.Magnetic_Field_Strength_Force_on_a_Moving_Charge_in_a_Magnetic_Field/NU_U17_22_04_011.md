# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A physicist performing a sensitive measurement wants to limit the magnetic force on a moving charge in her equipment to less than ($force) (times 10^-12 , (N). What is the greatest the charge can be if it moves at a maximum speed of ($speed , (m/s) in the Earth's field?
