# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Viewers of Star Trek hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship Enterprise. One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store antimatter charged particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, and then extract them as needed. Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy. What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons, moving at ($speed) (times 10^7 , (m/s) in a circular path ($radius , (m) in radius? Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but the opposite (negative) charge.
