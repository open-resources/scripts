# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An oxygen-16 ion with a mass of ($mass times 10^-26 , (kg) travels at ($speed) (times 10^6 , (m/s) perpendicular to a ($T , (T) magnetic field, which makes it move in a circular arc with a ($radius , (m) radius. What positive charge is on the ion? 
## Part 2 
What is the ratio of this charge to the charge of an electron?
