# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Triply charged uranium-235 and uranium-238 ions are being separated in a mass spectrometer. (The much rarer uranium-235 is used as reactor fuel.) The masses of the ions are (3.90 times 10^-25 , (kg) and (3.95 times 10^-25 , (kg), respectively, and they travel at (3.00 times 10^5 , (m/s) in a (0.250 , (T) field. 
## Part 2 
What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle?
