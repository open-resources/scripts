# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An electron in a TV CRT moves with a speed of ($speed) (times 10^7 , (m/s), in a direction perpendicular to the Earth's field, which has a strength of ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T). 
## Part 2 
What strength electric field must be applied perpendicular to the Earth's field to make the electron moves in a straight line? 
## Part 3 
If this is done between plates separated by ($D , (cm), what is the voltage applied? (Note that TVs are usually surrounded by a ferromagnetic material to shield against external magnetic fields and avoid the need for such a correction.)
