# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A patient with a pacemaker is mistakenly being scanned for an MRI image. A ($length , (cm) long section of pacemaker wire moves at a speed of ($speed , (cm/s) perpendicular to the MRI unit's magnetic field and a ($voltage , (mV) Hall voltage is induced. What is the magnetic field strength?
