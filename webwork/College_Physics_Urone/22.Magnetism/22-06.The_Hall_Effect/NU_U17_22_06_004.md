# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A nonmechanical water meter could utilize the Hall effect by applying a magnetic field across a metal pipe and measuring the Hall voltage produced. What is the average fluid velocity in a ($diameter , (cm) diameter pipe, if a ($strength , (T) field across it creates a ($voltage , (mV) Hall voltage?
