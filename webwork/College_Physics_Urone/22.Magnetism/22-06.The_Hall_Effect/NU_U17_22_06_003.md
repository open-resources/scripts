# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the speed of a supersonic aircraft with a ($wingspan , (m) wingspan, if it experiences a ($voltage , (V) Hall voltage between its wing tips when in level flight over the north magnetic pole, where the Earth's field strength is ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T)?
