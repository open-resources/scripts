# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($turns)-turn circular loop of radius ($radius , (cm) is vertical, with its axis on an east-west line. A current of ($current , (A) circulates clockwise in the loop when viewed from the east. The Earth's field here is due north, parallel to the ground, with a strength of ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T). What is the magnitude of the torque on the loop?
