# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A proton has a magnetic field due to its spin on its axis. The field is similar to that created by a circular current loop ($radius) (times 10^-15 , (m) in radius with a current of ($current) (times 10^4 , (A). Find the maximum torque on a proton in a ($strength , (T) field.
