# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
One long straight wire is to be held directly above another by repulsion between their currents. The lower wire carries ($current) A and the wire ($distance , (cm) above it is 10-gauge (($diameter , (mm) diameter) copper wire. 
## Part 2 
What current must flow in the upper wire, neglecting the Earth's field? 
## Part 3 
What is the smallest current if the Earth's ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T) field is parallel to the ground and is not neglected?
