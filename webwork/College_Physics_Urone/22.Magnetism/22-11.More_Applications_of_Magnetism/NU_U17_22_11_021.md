# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the maximum torque on a ($turns) turn, ($radius , (cm) radius circular current loop carrying ($current) μ(A) in a ($strength , (T) field. 
## Part 2 
If this coil is to be used in a galvanometer that reads ($scale) μ(A) full scale, what force constant spring must be used, if it is attached ($distance , (cm) from the axis of rotation and is stretched by the (60^circ) arc moved?
