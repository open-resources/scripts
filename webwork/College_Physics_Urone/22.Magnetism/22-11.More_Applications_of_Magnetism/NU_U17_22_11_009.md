# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
How far from the starter cable of a car, carrying ($current , (A), must you be to experience a field less than the Earth's ((5.00) (times 10^-5) (T))? Assume a long straight wire carries the current. (In practice, the body of your car shields the dashboard compass.)
