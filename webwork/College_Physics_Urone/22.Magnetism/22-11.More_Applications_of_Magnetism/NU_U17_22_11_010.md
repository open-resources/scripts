# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Estimate the field the loop creates by calculating the field at the center of a circular loop ($diameter) (cm) in diameter carrying ($current) (A). 
## Part 2 
What is the smallest field strength this loop can be used to measure, if its field must alter the measured field by less than ($percent) (%)?
