# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
To construct a nonmechanical water meter, a ($strength , (T) magnetic field is placed across the supply water pipe to a home and the Hall voltage is recorded. 
## Part 2 
Find the flow rate in liters per second through a ($diameter , (cm) diameter pipe if the Hall voltage is ($voltage , (mV). 
## Part 3 
What would the Hall voltage be for the same flow rate through a ($diameter_b , (cm) diameter pipe with the same field applied?
