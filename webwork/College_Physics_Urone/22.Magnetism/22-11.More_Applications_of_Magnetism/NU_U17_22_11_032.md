# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A surveyor ($distance , (m) from a long straight (200 , (kV) DC power line suspects that its magnetic field may equal that of the Earth and affect compass readings. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the wire needed to create a ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T) current in the field at this distance.
