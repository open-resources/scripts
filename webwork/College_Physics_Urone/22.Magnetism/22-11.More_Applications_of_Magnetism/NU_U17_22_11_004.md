# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
To see why an MRI utilizes iron to increase the magnetic field created by a coil, calculate the current needed in a ($loops)-loop-per-meter circular coil (0.660 , (m) in radius to create a ($strength , (T) field (typical of an MRI instrument) at its center with no iron present. 
## Part 2 
The magnetic field of a proton is approximately like that of a circular current loop ($radius) (times 10^-15 , (m) in radius carrying ($current) (times 10^4 , (A) . What is the field at the center of such a loop?
