# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($mass , (kg) baseball, pitched at ($speed , (m/s) horizontally and perpendicular to the Earth's horizontal ($strength) (times 10^-5 , (T) field, has a ($charge , (nC) charge on it. What distance is it deflected from its path by the magnetic force, after traveling ($distance , (m) horizontally?
