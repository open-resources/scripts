# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A (pi)-meson is a particle that decays into a muon and a massless particle. The (pi)-meson has a rest mass energy of ($Energypi) MeV, and the muon has a rest mass energy of ($Energyu) MeV. Suppose the (pi)-meson is at rest and all of the missing mass goes into the muon's kinetic energy. How fast will the muon move?
