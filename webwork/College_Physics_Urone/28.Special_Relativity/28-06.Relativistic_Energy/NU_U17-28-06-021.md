# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A barrel of crude oil can release (5.90 times 10^9) J of energy. Find the mass destroyed when this energy is released. 
## Part 2 
Given these barrels contain ($litres) litres and assuming the density of crude oil is ($density) (kg/m^3), what is the ratio of mass destroyed to original mass?
