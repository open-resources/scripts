# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose you use an average of ($kWh) kWh of electric energy per month in your home. 
## Part 2 
How long would ($mass) g of mass converted to electric energy with an efficiency of ($percent)% last you? 
## Part 3 
How many homes could be supplied at the ($kWh) kWh per month rate for one year by the energy from the described mass conversion?
