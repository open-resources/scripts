# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A positron is an antimatter version of the electron, having exactly the same mass. When a positron and an electron meet, they annihilate, converting all of their mass into energy. 
## Part 2 
Find the energy released, assuming negligible kinetic energy before the annihilation. 
## Part 3 
If this energy is given to a proton in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity? 
## Part 4 
If this energy is given to another electron in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?
