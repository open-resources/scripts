# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A proton has a mass of (1.67 times 10^-27) kg. A physicist measures the proton's total energy to be ($Energy) MeV. 
## Part 2 
What is the proton's kinetic energy? 
## Part 3 
Unreasonable Results: Notice that the calculated result is negative, but the proton must have a positive value for kinetic energy.
