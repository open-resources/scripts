# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount. 
## Part 2 
What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of ($radiuskm) km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.) 
## Part 3 
If the ship has a mass of (1.00 times 10^5) kg ((100) tons), what total yield nuclear explosion in tons of TNT is needed if it releases (4.2 times10^9, J/ton )?
