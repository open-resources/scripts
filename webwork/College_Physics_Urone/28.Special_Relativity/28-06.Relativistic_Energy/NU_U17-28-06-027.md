# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The Sun produces energy at a rate of (4.00 times 10^26) W by the fusion of hydrogen. 
## Part 2 
How many kilograms of hydrogen undergo fusion each second? 
## Part 3 
If the Sun is (90.0)% hydrogen and half of this can undergo fusion before the Sun changes character, how long could it produce energy at its current rate? 
## Part 4 
How many kilograms of mass is the Sun losing per second? 
## Part 5 
What fraction of its mass will it have lost in the time found in part (b)?
