# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In World War II, there were several reported cases of airmen who jumped from their flaming airplanes with no parachute to escape certain death. Some fell about (20,000 , (feet) ((6000 , (m)), and some of them survived, with few life-threatening injuries. For these lucky pilots, the tree branches and snow drifts on the ground allowed their deceleration to be relatively small. If we assume that a pilot's speed upon impact was (123 , (mph) ((54 , (m/s)), then what was his deceleration? Assume that the trees and snow stopped him over a distance of (3.0 , (m).
