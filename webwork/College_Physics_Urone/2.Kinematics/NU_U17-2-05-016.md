# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Consider a grey squirrel falling out of a tree to the ground. 
## Part 2 
If we ignore air resistance in this case (only for the sake of this problem), determine a squirrel's velocity just before hitting the ground, assuming it fell from a height of ($a , (m). 
## Part 3 
If the squirrel stops in a distance of ($b , (cm) through bending its limbs, what is its deceleration?
