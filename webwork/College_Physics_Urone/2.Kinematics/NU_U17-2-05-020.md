# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In 1967, New Zealander Burt Munro set the world record for an Indian motorcycle, on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, of (183.58 , (mi/h) ((82.068 ,(m/s)). The one-way course was (5.00 , (mi) long ((8050 , (m)). Acceleration rates are often described by the time it takes to reach (60.0 , (mi/h) ((26.8 , (m/s)) from rest. If this time was (4.00 , (s), and Burt accelerated at this rate until he reached his maximum speed, how long did it take Burt to complete the course?
