# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A world record was set for the men's (100 , (m) dash in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing by Usain Bolt of Jamaica. Bolt “coasted” across the finish line with a time of (9.69 , (s). If we assume that Bolt accelerated for (3.00 , (s) to reach his maximum speed, and maintained that speed for the rest of the race, calculate his maximum speed and his acceleration. 
## Part 2 
During the same Olympics, Bolt also set the world record in the (200 , (m) dash with a time of (19.30 , (s). Using the same assumptions as for the (100 , (m) dash (that is, it took him (3.00 , (s) to reach maximum speed), what was his maximum speed for this race?
