## Part 0 
(a) The subway train moves to the right from ( x_0 ) to ( x_f ). Its displacement, ( Delta x), is (+2.0 ,km ). (b) The train moves to the left from (x'_0) to (x'_f). Its displacement ( Delta x') is ( -1.5 ,km). 
## Part 1 
The train accelerates from rest to (30.0 ,kmh ). After, it slows to a stop in ( 30.0 km/h ). 
## Part 2 
Construct the displacement graph for the subway shuttle train as shown in the above figure.
