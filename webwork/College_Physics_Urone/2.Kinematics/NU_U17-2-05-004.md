# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A light-rail commuter train accelerates at a rate of ($acceleration , (m/s^2). How long does it take to reach its top speed of ($speed , (km/h), starting from rest? 
## Part 2 
The same train ordinarily decelerates at a rate of ($deceleration , (m/s^2). How long does it take to come to a stop from its top speed? 
## Part 3 
In emergencies the train can decelerate more rapidly, coming to rest from ($speedkm/h ) in ($time  s ). What is its emergency deceleration?
