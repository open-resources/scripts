# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
On May 26, 1934, a streamlined, stainless steel diesel train called the Zephyr set the world's nonstop long-distance speed record for trains. Its run from Denver to Chicago took (13) hours, (4) minutes, (58) seconds, and was witnessed by more than a million people along the route. The total distance traveled was (1633.8, km). What was its average speed in m/s?
