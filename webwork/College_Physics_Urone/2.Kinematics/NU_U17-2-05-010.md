# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Freight trains can produce only relatively small accelerations and decelerations. 
## Part 2 
What is the final velocity of a freight train that accelerates at a rate of ($accel , (m/s^2) for ($time , (min), starting with an initial velocity of ($velocity , (m/s)? 
## Part 3 
 If the train can slow down at a rate of ($accel2 , (m/s^2), how long will it take to come to a stop from this velocity?
