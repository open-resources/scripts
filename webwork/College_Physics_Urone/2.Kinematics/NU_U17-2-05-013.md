# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A woodpecker's brain is specially protected from large decelerations by tendon-like attachments inside the skull. While pecking on a tree, the woodpecker's head comes to a stop from an initial velocity of ($v , (m/s) in a distance of only ($d1 , (mm). 
## Part 2 
Find the acceleration in multiples of (9.8, (m/s^2) ((g)). 
## Part 3 
Calculate the stopping time. 
## Part 4 
The tendons cradling the brain stretch, making its stopping distance ($d2 , (mm) (greater than the head and, hence, less deceleration of the brain). What is the brain's deceleration, expressed in multiples of (g) ?
