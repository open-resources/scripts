# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The planetary model of the atom pictures electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus much as planets orbit the Sun. In this model you can view hydrogen, the simplest atom, as having a single electron in a circular orbit ($distance times 10^-10) (m) in diameter. (a) If the average speed of the electron in this orbit is known to be ($speed times 10^6) (m/s), calculate the number of revolutions per second it makes about the nucleus. (b) What is the electron's average velocity over five complete revolutions?
