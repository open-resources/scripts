# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The speed of propagation of the action potential (an electrical signal) in a nerve cell depends (inversely) on the diameter of the axon (nerve fiber). If the nerve cell connecting the spinal cord to your feet is ($length , m) long, and the nerve impulse speed is ($speed , m/s), how long does it take for the nerve signal to travel this distance?
