# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An unwary football player collides with a padded goalpost while running at a velocity of ($v , (m/s) and comes to a full stop after compressing the padding and his body ($d , (m). 
## Part 2 
What is his deceleration? 
## Part 3 
How long does the collision last?
