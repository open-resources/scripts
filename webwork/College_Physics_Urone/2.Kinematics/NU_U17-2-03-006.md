# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Tidal friction is slowing the rotation of the Earth. As a result, the orbit of the Moon is increasing in radius at a rate of approximately (4, cm/year). Assuming this to be a constant rate, how many years will pass before the radius of the Moon's orbit increases by (3.84 times 10^6 , m) (which is (1%) of its current value)?
