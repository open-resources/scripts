# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A swimmer bounces straight up from a diving board and falls feet first into a pool. She starts with a velocity of ($v , (m/s), and her takeoff point is ($d , (m) above the pool. 
## Part 2 
How long are her feet in the air? 
## Part 3 
What is her highest point above the board? 
## Part 4 
What is the magnitude of her velocity when her feet hit the water?
