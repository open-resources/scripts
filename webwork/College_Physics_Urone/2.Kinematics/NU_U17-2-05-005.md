# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
While entering a freeway, a car accelerates from rest at a rate of ($acceleration, (m/s^2) for ($time , (s). To help with this question, draw a sketch of the situation and list the knowns in this problem. 
## Part 2 
How far does the car travel in those ($time , (s)? 
## Part 3 
What is the car's final velocity?
