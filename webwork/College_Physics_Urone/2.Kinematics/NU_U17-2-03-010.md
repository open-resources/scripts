# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A football quarterback runs ($d1 , m) straight down the playing field in ($t1 , s). He is then hit and pushed ($d2 , m) straight backward in ($t2 , s). He breaks the tackle and runs straight forward another ($d3 , m) in ($t3 , s). Calculate his average velocity (a) for each of the three intervals and (b) for the entire motion. 
## Part 2
