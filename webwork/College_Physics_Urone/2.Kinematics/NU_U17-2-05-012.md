# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A swan on a lake gets airborne by flapping its wings and running on top of the water. 
## Part 2 
If the swan must reach a velocity of ($speed , (m/s) to take off and it accelerates from rest at an average rate of ($a , (m/s^2), how far will it travel before becoming airborne? 
## Part 3 
How long does this take?
