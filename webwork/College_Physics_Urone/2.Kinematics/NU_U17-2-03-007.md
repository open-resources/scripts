# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A student drove to the university from her home and noted that the odometer reading of her car increased by ($odometer , km). The trip took ($time , min). 
## Part 2 
What was her average speed? 
## Part 3 
If the straight-line distance from her home to the university is ($distance , km) in a direction ($angle^circ) south of east, what was her average velocity in this direction? 
## Part 4 
If she arrived home by the same path (7) (h) (30) (min) after she left, what were her average speed and velocity for the entire trip? 
## Part 5 
Average Speed = ans_rule(20) (km/h) 
## Part 6 
Average Velocity = ans_rule(20) (km/h)
