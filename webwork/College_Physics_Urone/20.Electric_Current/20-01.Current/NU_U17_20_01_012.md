# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Electron guns are used in X-ray tubes. The electrons are accelerated through a relatively large voltage and directed onto a metal target, producing X-rays. 
## Part 2 
How many electrons per second strike the target if the current is ($A , (mA)? 
## Part 3 
What charge strikes the target in ($t , (s)?
