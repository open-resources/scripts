# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Foolishly trying to fish a burning piece of bread from a toaster with a metal butter knife, a man comes into contact with ($V , (V) AC. He does not even feel it since, luckily, he is wearing rubber-soled shoes. What is the minimum resistance of the path the current follows through the person?
