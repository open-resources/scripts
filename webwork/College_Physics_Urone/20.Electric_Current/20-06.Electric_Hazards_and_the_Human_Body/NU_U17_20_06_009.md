# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A short circuit in a ($V , (V) appliance cord has a ($R , (Omega) resistance. Calculate the temperature rise of the ($mass , (g) of surrounding materials, assuming their specific heat capacity is ($heatc) (cal/g) (cdot) (^circ(C) and that it takes ($t , (s) for a circuit breaker to interrupt the current.
