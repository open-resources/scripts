# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Cold vaporizers pass a current through water, evaporating it with only a small increase in temperature. One such home device is rated at ($A , (A) and utilizes ($V , (V) AC with ($C, (%) efficiency. 
## Part 2 
What is the vaporization rate in grams per minute? 
## Part 3 
How much water must you put into the vaporizer for ($T , (h) of overnight operation?
