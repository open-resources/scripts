# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What would be the maximum cost of a CFL such that the total cost (investment plus operating) would be the same for both CFL and incandescent ($W , (W) bulbs? Assume the cost of the incandescent bulb is ($P , (cents) and that electricity costs ($Ph , (cents/kWh) . Calculate the cost for ($T , (hours), as in the cost effectiveness of CFL example.
