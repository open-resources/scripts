# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Hydroelectric generators at Hoover Dam produce a maximum current of ($A) (times 10^3) (A) at ($V , (kV). 
## Part 2 
What is the power output? 
## Part 3 
The water that powers the generators enters and leaves the system at low speed (thus its kinetic energy does not change) but loses ($D , (m) in altitude. How many cubic meters per second are needed, assuming ($C , (%) efficiency?
