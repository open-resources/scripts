# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Digital medical thermometers determine temperature by measuring the resistance of a semiconductor device called a thermistor (which has (alpha) = ($a) / (^circ(C) ) when it is at the same temperature as the patient. What is a patient's temperature if the thermistor's resistance at that temperature is ($P , (%) of its value at ($T^circ(C) (normal body temperature)?
