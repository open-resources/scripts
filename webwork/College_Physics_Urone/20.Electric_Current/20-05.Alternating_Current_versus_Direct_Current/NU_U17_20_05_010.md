# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Two different electrical devices have the same power consumption, but one is meant to be operated on ($V1 , (V) AC and the other on ($V2 , (V) AC. 
## Part 2 
What is the ratio of their resistances? 
## Part 3 
What is the ratio of their currents? 
## Part 4 
Assuming its resistance is unaffected, by what factor will the power increase if a ($V1 , (V) AC device is connected to ($V2 , (V) AC?
