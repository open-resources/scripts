# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Estimate the mass of the luminous matter in the known universe, given there are (10^11) galaxies, each containing (10^11) stars of average mass (1.5) times that of our Sun.$BR$BRans_rule(40) kg$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$MassL"));b) How many protons (the most abundant nuclide) are there in this mass? $BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$protonsb"));c) Estimate the total number of particles in the observable universe by multiplying the answer to (b) by two, since there is an electron for each proton, and then by (10^9), since there are far more particles (such as photons and neutrinos) in space than in luminous matter.$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
