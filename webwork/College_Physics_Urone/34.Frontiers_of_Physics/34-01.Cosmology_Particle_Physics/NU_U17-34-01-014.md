# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The peak intensity of the CMBR occurs at a wavelength of ($lambda) mm. $BRa) What is the energy in eV of a ($lambda)-mm photon? $BR$BRans_rule(40) eV$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Energy"));b) There are approximately(10^9) photons for each massive particle in deep space. Calculate the energy (10^9) of such photons. $BR$BRans_rule(40) MeV$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Energyphotons"));c) If the average massive particle in space has a mass half that of a proton, what energywould be created by converting its mass to energy?$BR$BRans_rule(40) MeV$BR$BR
