# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Assuming a circular orbit for the Sun about the center of the Milky Way galaxy,calculate its orbital speed using the following information: The mass of the galaxy isequivalent to a single mass (1.5 times 10^11) times that of the Sun (or (3 times 10^41) kg), located ($distance) ly away.$BR$BRans_rule(40) m/s$BR$BR
