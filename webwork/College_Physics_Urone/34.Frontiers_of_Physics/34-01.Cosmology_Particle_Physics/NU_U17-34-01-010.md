# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the approximate force of gravity on a ($mass)-kg person due to the Andromeda galaxy, assuming its total mass is (10^13) that of our Sun and acts like a single mass ($distance) Mly away? $BR$BRans_rule(40) N$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$ForceG"));b) What is the ratio of this force to the person's weight? Note that Andromeda is the closest large galaxy.$BR$BRans_rule(40) (times 10^-13)$BR$BR
