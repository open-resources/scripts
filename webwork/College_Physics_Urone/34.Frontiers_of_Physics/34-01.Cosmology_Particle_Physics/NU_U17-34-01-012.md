# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A particle and its antiparticle are at rest relative to an observer and annihilate(completely destroying both masses), creating two rays of equal energy. What isthe characteristic (gamma)-ray energy you would look for if searching for evidence of proton antiproton annihilation? (The fact that such radiation is rarely observed is evidencethat there is very little antimatter in the universe.) $BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$MeV"));b) How does this compare with the (0.511)-MeV energy associated with electron-positron annihilation?$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
