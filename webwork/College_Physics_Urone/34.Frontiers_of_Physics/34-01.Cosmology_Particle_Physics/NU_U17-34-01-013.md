# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The average particle energy needed to observe unification of forces is estimated to be(10^19) GeV. $BRa) What is the rest mass in kilograms of a particle that has a rest mass of (10^19) (GeV/c^2)? $BR$BRans_rule(40) kg$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$mass"));b) How many times the mass of a hydrogen atom is this?$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
