# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the approximate velocity relative to us of a galaxy near the edge of theknown universe, some ($distance) Gly away? $BR$BRans_rule(40) km/s$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$velocity"));b) What fraction of the speed of light is this? Note that we have observed galaxies moving away from us at greater than (0.9c).$BR$BRans_rule(40) (c)$BR$BR
