# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If the dark matter in the Milky Way were composed entirely of MACHOs (evidenceshows it is not), approximately how many would there have to be? Assume theaverage mass of a MACHO is (1/1000) that of the Sun, and that dark matter has a mass(10) times that of the luminous Milky Way galaxy with its (10^11) stars of average mass (1.5) times the Sun's mass.$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
