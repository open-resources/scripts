# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
To get an idea of how empty deep space is on the average, perform the followingcalculations: $BRa) Find the volume our Sun would occupy if it had an average density equal to the critical density of (10^26) (kg/m^3) thought necessary to halt the expansion of the universe. $BR$BRans_rule(40) (m^3)$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Volume"));b) Find the radius of a sphere of this volume in light years. $BR$BRans_rule(40) ly$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$radius"));c) What would this radius be if the density were that of luminous matter, which is approximately ($percent)% that of the critical density?$BR$BRans_rule(40) ly$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$radiuspercent"));d) Compare the radius found in part (c) with the ($separation)-ly average separation of stars in the arms of the Milky Way.$BR$BRans_rule(40) ly$BR$BR
