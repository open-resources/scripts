# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A section of superconducting wire carries a current of ($Intensity) A and requires (1.00) L of liquid nitrogen per hour to keep it below its critical temperature. For it to beeconomically advantageous to use a superconducting wire, the cost of cooling thewire must be less than the cost of energy lost to heat in the wire. Assume that the costof liquid nitrogen is $($costnitrogen) per litre, and that electric energy costs $($costelectric) per kWÂ·h. $BRWhat is the resistance of a normal wire that costs as much in wasted electric energy as the cost of liquid nitrogen for the superconductor?$BR$BRans_rule(40) (Omega)$BR$BR
