# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you want to measure resistances in the range from ($Rx) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> to ($Rx) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> using a Wheatstone bridge that has (fracR_2R_1 = ($R2divR1). Over what range should (R)(_3) be adjustable? 
## Part 1
