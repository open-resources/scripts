# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An ECG monitor must have an RC time constant less than ($t times 10^2) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;s</span> to be able to measure variations in voltage over small time intervals. 
## Part 1 
If the resistance of the circuit (due mostly to that of the patient's chest) is ($resistance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span>, what is the maximum capacitance of the circuit?
