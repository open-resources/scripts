<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> If you wish to take a picture of a bullet traveling at ($velocitySI) (m/s), then a very brief flash of light produced by an RC discharge through a flash tube can limit blurring. Assuming ($distance) (mm) of motion during one RC constant is acceptable, and given that the flash is driven by a ($capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor, what is the resistance in the flash tube?
