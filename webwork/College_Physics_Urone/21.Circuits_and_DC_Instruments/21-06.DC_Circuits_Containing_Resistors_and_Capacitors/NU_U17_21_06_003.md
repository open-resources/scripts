# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The duration of a photographic flash is related to an RC time constant, which is ($tflash) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;s</span> for a certain camera. 
## Part 1 
If the resistance of the flash lamp is ($resflashSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> during discharge, what is the size of the capacitor supplying its energy? 
## Part 2 
What is the time constant for charging the capacitor, if the charging resistance is ($rescharge) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span>?
