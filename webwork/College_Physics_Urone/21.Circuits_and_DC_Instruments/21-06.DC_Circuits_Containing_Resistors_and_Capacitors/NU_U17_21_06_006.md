# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($resistorSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor, an uncharged ($capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor, and a ($emfSI)-(V) emf are connected in series. 
## Part 1 
What is the initial current? 
## Part 2 
What is the RC time constant? 
## Part 3 
What is the current after one time constant? 
## Part 4
