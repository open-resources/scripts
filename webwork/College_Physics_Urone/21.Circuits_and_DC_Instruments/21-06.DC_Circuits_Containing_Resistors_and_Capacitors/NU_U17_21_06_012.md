# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A flashing lamp in a Christmas earring is based on an RC discharge of a capacitor through its resistance. The effective duration of the flash is ($timeSI) (s), during which it produces an average ($powerSI) (W) from an average ($voltageSI) (V). 
## Part 1 
What energy does it dissipate? 
## Part 2 
How much charge moves through the lamp? 
## Part 3 
What is the resistance of the lamp? 
## Part 4 
Find the capacitance.
