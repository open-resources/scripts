# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor charged to ($voltageSI) (V) is discharged through a ($resistance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor. 
## Part 1 
Find the time constant. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the temperature increase of the resistor, given that its mass is ($mass) g and its specific heat is ($heatcap) (frackJkg(^circC) noting that most of the thermal energy is retained in the short time of the discharge. 
## Part 3 
Calculate the new resistance, assuming it is pure carbon.
