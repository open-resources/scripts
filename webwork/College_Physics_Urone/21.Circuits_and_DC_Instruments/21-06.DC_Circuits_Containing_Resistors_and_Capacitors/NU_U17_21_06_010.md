# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Using the exact exponential treatment, find how much time is required to charge an initially uncharged ($capacitance)-(pF) capacitor through a ($resistance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;</span> resistor to ($percent)(%) of its final voltage.
