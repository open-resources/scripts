# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The timing device in an automobile's intermittent wiper system is based on an RC time constant and utilizes a ($capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor and a variable resistor. Over what range must its resistance be made to vary to achieve time constants from ($t1) (s) to ($t2) (s)?
