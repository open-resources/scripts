## Part 0 
Suppose you measure the terminal voltage of a ($emfSI)-(V) alkaline cell having an internal resistance of ($intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> by placing a ($resvolt)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> voltmeter across its terminals as in the figure above. 
## Part 1 
What current flows? 
## Part 2 
Find the terminal voltage. 
## Part 3 
To see how close the measured terminal voltage is to the emf, calculate their ratio.
