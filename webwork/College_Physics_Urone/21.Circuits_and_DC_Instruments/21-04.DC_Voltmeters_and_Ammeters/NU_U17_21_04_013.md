# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($resammSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> ammeter is placed in series with a ($resistorSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor in a circuit. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the resistance of the combination? 
## Part 2 
If the voltage across the combination is kept the same as it was across the ($resistorSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percent decrease in current? 
## Part 3 
If the current through the combination is kept the same as it was through the ($resistorSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percentage decrease in voltage?
