# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Suppose you have a ($resgalvSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> galvanometer with a ($current)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A</span> sensitivity. 
## Part 1 
What resistance would you put in series with it to allow it to be used as a voltmeter that has a full-scale deflection for ($emf) (mV)?
