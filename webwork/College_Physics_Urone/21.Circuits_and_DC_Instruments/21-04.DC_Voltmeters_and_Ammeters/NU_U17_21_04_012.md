# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($resvolt)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;</span> voltmeter is placed in parallel with a ($resistor)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor in a circuit. 
## Part 1 
What is the resistance of the combination? 
## Part 2 
If the voltage across the combination is kept the same as it was across the ($resistor)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percent increase in current? 
## Part 3 
If the current through the combination is kept the same as it was through the ($resistor)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percentage decrease in voltage?
