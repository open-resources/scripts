# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($emfSI)-(V) emf automobile battery has a terminal voltage of ($terminalvoltageSI) (V) when being charged by a current of ($currentSI) (A). 
## Part 1 
What is the battery's internal resistance? 
## Part 2 
What power is dissipated inside the battery? 
## Part 3 
At what rate will its temperature increase if its mass is ($massSI) (kg) and it has a specific heat capacity of ($heatcap) (kcal/kg)(^circC), assuming no heat escapes?
