# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A child's electronic toy is supplied by (3), ($emfalkSI)-(V) alkaline cells having internal resistances of ($resalkSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> in series with a ($emfcellSI)-(V) carbon-zinc dry cell having a ($rescellSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> internal resistance. The load resistance is ($restoySI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> . 
## Part 1 
What current flows? 
## Part 2 
How much power is supplied to the load? 
## Part 3 
What is the internal resistance of the dry cell if it goes bad, resulting in only ($powertoynewSI) (W) being supplied to the load? Assume all other factors, including the emf supplied by the dry cell, are held constant.
