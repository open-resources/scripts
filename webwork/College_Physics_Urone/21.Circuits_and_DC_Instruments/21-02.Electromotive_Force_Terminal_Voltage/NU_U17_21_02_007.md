# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A car battery with a ($emfSI)-(V) emf and an internal resistance of ($intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> is being charged with a current of ($currentSI) (A). Note that in this process the battery is being charged. 
## Part 1 
What is the potential difference across its terminals? 
## Part 2 
At what rate is thermal energy being dissipated in the battery? 
## Part 3 
At what rate is electric energy being converted to chemical energy?
