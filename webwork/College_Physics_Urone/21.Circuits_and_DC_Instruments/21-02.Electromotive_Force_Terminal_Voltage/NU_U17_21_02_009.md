# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The label on a portable radio recommends the use of rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells (NiCads), although they have a ($emfnickelSI)-(V) emf while alkaline cells have a ($emfalkSI)-(V) emf. The radio has a ($resradioSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistance. Calculate the power delivered to the radio: 
## Part 1 
When using NiCad cells each having an internal resistance of ($resnickelSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>. 
## Part 2 
When using alkaline cells each having an internal resistance of ($resalkSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>.
