# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An automobile starter motor has an equivalent resistance of ($resmotorSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> and is supplied by a ($emfSI)-(V) battery with a ($intresSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> internal resistance. 
## Part 1 
What is the current to the motor? 
## Part 2 
What voltage is applied to it? 
## Part 3 
What power is supplied to the motor?
