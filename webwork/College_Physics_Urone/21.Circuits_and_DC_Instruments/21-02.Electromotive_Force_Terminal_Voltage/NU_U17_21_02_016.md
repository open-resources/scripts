# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A ($emfSI)-(V) alkaline cell with a ($intres)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> internal resistance is supplying ($currentSI) (A) to a load. 
## Part 1 
What is its terminal voltage? 
## Part 2 
What is the value of the load resistance?
