# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the terminal voltage of a large ($emfSI)-(V) carbon-zinc dry cell used in a physics lab to supply ($currentSI) (A) to a circuit, if the cell's internal resistance is ($intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>? 
## Part 1 
How much electrical power does the cell produce? 
## Part 2 
What power goes to its load?
