# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A person with body resistance between his hands of ($resbody) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> accidentally grasps the terminals of a ($emfline)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> power supply. (Do NOT do this!) 
## Part 1 
If the internal resistance of the power supply is ($resintSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>, what is the current through his body? 
## Part 2 
What is the power dissipated in his body? 
## Part 3 
If the power supply is to be made safe by increasing its internal resistance, what should the internal resistance be for the maximum current in this situation to be ($currentsafe) (mA) or less?
