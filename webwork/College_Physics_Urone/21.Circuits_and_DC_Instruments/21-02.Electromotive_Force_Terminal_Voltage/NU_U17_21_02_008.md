# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The hot resistance of a flashlight bulb is ($resbulbSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> , and it is run by a ($emfSI)-(V) alkaline cell having a ($intresSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> internal resistance. 
## Part 1 
What current flows? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the power supplied to the bulb.
