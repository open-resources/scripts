# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Carbon-zinc dry cells (sometimes referred to as non-alkaline cells) have an emf of (1.54) (V), and they are produced as single cells or in various combinations to form other voltages. 
## Part 1 
How many (1.54)-(V) cells are needed to make the common (9)-(V) battery used in many small electronic devices? 
## Part 2 
What is the actual emf of the approximately (9)-(V) battery?
