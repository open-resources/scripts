# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Your car's ($powerheadlightSI)-(W) headlight and ($powerstarter)-(kW) starter are ordinarily connected in parallel in a ($voltageSI)-(V) system. What power would one headlight and the starter consume if connected in series to a ($voltageSI)-(V) battery? (Neglect any other resistance in the circuit and any change in resistance in the two devices.)
