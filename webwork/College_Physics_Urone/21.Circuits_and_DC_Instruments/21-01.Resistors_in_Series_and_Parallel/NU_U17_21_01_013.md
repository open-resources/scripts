# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Two resistors, one having a resistance of ($res1) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> , are connected in series to produce a total resistance of ($seriesresistance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;</span>. 
## Part 1 
What is the value of the second resistance?
