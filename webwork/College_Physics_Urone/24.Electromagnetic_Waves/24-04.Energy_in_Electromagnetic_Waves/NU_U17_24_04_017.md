# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If electric and magnetic field strengths vary sinusoidally in time, being zero at (t = 0) , then (E = E_0sin2 pi ft) and (B = B_0sin2 pi ft) . Let (f = ) ($frequency , (GHz). 
## Part 2 
When are the field strengths first zero? 
## Part 3 
When do they reach their most negative value? 
## Part 4 
How much time is needed for them to complete one cycle?
