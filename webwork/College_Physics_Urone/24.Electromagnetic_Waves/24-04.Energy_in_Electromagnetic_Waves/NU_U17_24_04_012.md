# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Police radar determines the speed of motor vehicles using the same Doppler-shift technique employed for ultrasound in medical diagnostics. Beats are produced by mixing the double Doppler-shifted echo with the original frequency. If ($frequency_micro) (times 10^9 , (Hz) microwaves are used and a beat frequency of ($frequency_beat , (Hz) is produced, what is the speed of the vehicle? (Assume the same Doppler-shift formulas are valid with the speed of sound replaced by the speed of light.)
