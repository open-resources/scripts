# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Lasers can be constructed that produce an extremely high intensity electromagnetic wave for a brief timeâ€”called pulsed lasers. They are used to ignite nuclear fusion, for example. Such a laser may produce an electromagnetic wave with a maximum electric field strength of ($strength) (times 10^11 , (V/m) for a time of ($time , (ns). 
## Part 2 
What is the maximum magnetic field strength in the wave? 
## Part 3 
What is the intensity of the beam? 
## Part 4 
What energy does it deliver on a ($area , (mm^2) area?
