# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Electromagnetic radiation from a ($laser , (mW) laser is concentrated on a ($area , (mm^2). 
## Part 2 
What is the intensity in (W/m^2)? 
## Part 3 
Suppose a ($charge , (nC) static charge is in the beam. What is the maximum electric force it experiences? 
## Part 4 
If the static charge moves at ($speed , (m/s), what maximum magnetic force can it feel?
