# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Assume the helium-neon lasers commonly used in student physics laboratories have power outputs of ($output) (mW). 
## Part 2 
If such a laser beam is projected onto a circular spot ($diameter , (mm) in diameter, what is its intensity? 
## Part 3 
Find the peak magnetic field strength. 
## Part 4
