# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
On its highest power setting, a microwave oven increases the temperature of ($mass , (kg) of spaghetti by ($temp^circ(C) in ($time , (s). 
## Part 2 
What was the rate of power absorption by the spaghetti, given that its specific heat is (3.76) (times 10^3 , (J/kg^circ(C)? 
## Part 3 
Find the average intensity of the microwaves, given that they are absorbed over a circular area ($diameter , (cm) in diameter. 
## Part 4 
What is the peak electric field strength of the microwave? 
## Part 5 
What is its peak magnetic field strength?
