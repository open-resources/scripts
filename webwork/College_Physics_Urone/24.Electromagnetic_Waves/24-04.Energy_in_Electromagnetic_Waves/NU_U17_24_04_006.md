# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($diameter , (m) diameter university communications satellite dish receives TV signals that have a maximum electric field strength (for one channel) of ($strength) (mu)(V/m). 
## Part 2 
What is the intensity of this wave? 
## Part 3 
What is the power received by the antenna? 
## Part 4 
If the orbiting satellite broadcasts uniformly over an area of ($area) (times 10^13 , (m^2) (a large fraction of North America), how much power does it radiate?
