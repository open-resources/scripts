# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>$BRA ($turns)-turn flat coil of wire ($diameter , (cm) in diameter acts as an antenna for FM radio at a frequency of ($frequency , (MHz). The magnetic field of the incoming electromagnetic wave is perpendicular to the coil and has a maximum strength of ($strength) (times 10^-12 , (T). 
## Part 2 
What power is incident on the coil? 
## Part 3 
What average emf is induced in the coil over one-fourth of a cycle? 
## Part 4 
If the radio receiver has an inductance of ($inductance) (mu)(H), what capacitance must it have to resonate at ($frequency) (MHz)?
