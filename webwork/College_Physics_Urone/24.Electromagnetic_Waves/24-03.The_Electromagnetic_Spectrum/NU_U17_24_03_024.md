# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the rate in watts at which heat transfer through radiation occurs (almost entirely in the infrared) from ($distance , (m^2) of the Earth's surface at night. Assume the emissivity is ($emissivity), the temperature of the Earth is ($T_earth ^circ(C), and that of outer space is ($T_space , (K). 
## Part 2 
Compare the intensity of this radiation with that coming to the Earth from the Sun during the day, which averages about ($radiation , (W/m^2), only half of which is absorbed. 
## Part 3 
What is the maximum magnetic field strength in the outgoing radiation, assuming it is a continuous wave?
