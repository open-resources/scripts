# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Distances in space are often quoted in units of light years, the distance light travels in one year. 
## Part 2 
How many meters is a light year? 
## Part 3 
How many meters is it to Andromeda, the nearest large galaxy, given that it is ($distance_a) (times 10^6) light years away? 
## Part 4 
The most distant galaxy yet discovered is ($distance_b) (times 10^9) light years away. How far is this in meters?
