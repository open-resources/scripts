# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Radar is used to determine distances to various objects by measuring the round-trip time for an echo from the object. 
## Part 2 
How far away is the planet Venus if the echo time is ($time , (s)? 
## Part 3 
What is the echo time for a car ($distance_car , (m) from a Highway Police radar unit? 
## Part 4 
How accurately (in nanoseconds) must you be able to measure the echo time to an airplane ($distance_plane , (km) away to determine its distance within ($range , (m)?
