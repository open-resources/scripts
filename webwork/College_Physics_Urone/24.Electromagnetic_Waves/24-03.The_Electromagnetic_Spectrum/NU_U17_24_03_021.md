# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Lunar astronauts placed a reflector on the Moon's surface, off which a laser beam is periodically reflected. The distance to the Moon is calculated from the round-trip time. 
## Part 2 
To what accuracy in meters can the distance to the Moon be determined, if this time can be measured to ($time) (ns)? 
## Part 3 
What percent accuracy is this, given the average distance to the Moon is ($distance) (times 10^8)?
