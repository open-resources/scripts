## Part 0 
The hydraulic system of a backhoe is used to lift a load as shown above. 
## Part 1 
(a) Calculate the force  the slave cylinder must exert to support the (400 , (kg) load and the (150 , (kg) brace and shovel. 
## Part 2 
(b) What is the pressure in the hydraulic fluid if the slave cylinder is (2.50 (cm) in diameter? 
## Part 3 
(c) What force would you have to exert on a lever with a mechanical advantage of (5.00) acting on a master cylinder (0.800 , (cm) in diameter to create this pressure?
