# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Assuming bicycle tires are perfectly flexible and support the weight of bicycle and rider by pressure alone, calculate the total area of the tires in contact with the ground. The bicycle plus rider has a mass of ($mass , (kg), and the gauge pressure in the tires is  (3.50 times 10^5 , (Pa).
