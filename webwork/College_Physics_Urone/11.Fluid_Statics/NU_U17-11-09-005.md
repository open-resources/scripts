# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Gauge pressure in the fluid surrounding an infant's brain may rise as high as ($mmHg , (mm Hg) ( (5) to (12) (mm Hg) is normal), creating an outward force large enough to make the skull grow abnormally large. 
## Part 2 
Calculate this outward force in newtons on each side of an infant's skull if the effective area of each side is ($area , (cm^2). 
## Part 3 
What is the net force acting on the skull?
