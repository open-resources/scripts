## Part 0 
Referring to the figure above, prove that the buoyant force on the cylinder is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced (Archimedes' principle). You may assume that the buoyant force is (F)<sub>2</sub> - (F)<sub>1</sub> and that the ends of the cylinder have equal areas (A). Note that the volume of the cylinder (and that of the fluid it displaces) equals ((h)<sub>2</sub> - (h)<sub>1</sub>) (times) (A). Note: This question refers to (F=PA). 
## Part 1 
What are the superscripts for the SI units of pressure m<sup>(alpha)</sup>s<sup>(beta)</sup>kg<sup>(gamma)</sup>? 
## Part 2 
(alpha) = ans_rule(10) (beta) = ans_rule(10)(gamma) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 3 
What are the superscripts for the SI units of (rho(gh) m<sup>(alpha)</sup>s<sup>(beta)</sup>kg<sup>(gamma)</sup>? 
## Part 4 
(alpha) = ans_rule(10) (beta) = ans_rule(10)(gamma) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 5 
Does (rho(gh) = P? Enter 0 for "yes" and 1 for "no". 
## Part 6 
Does (Ah) = (V) ? Enter 0 for "yes" and 1 for "no". 
## Part 7 
Does (rho(Vg) = (mg)? Enter 0 for "yes" and 1 for "no".
