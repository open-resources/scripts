# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the gauge pressures inside ($r , (cm) radius bubbles of water, alcohol, and soapy water. The surface tensions of water, alcohol, and soapy water are equal to (0.0728) , (0.0223) and (0.0370) (N/m^2) respectively. 
## Part 2 
Water = ans_rule(20) (N/m^2)
