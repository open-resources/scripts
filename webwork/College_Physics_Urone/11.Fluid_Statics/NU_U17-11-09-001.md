# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
During forced exhalation, such as when blowing up a balloon, the diaphragm and chest muscles create a pressure of ($pressure , (mm Hg) between the lungs and chest wall. What force in newtons does this pressure create on the ($area , (cm^2) surface area of the diaphragm?
