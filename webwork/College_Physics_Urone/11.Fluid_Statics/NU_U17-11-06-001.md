## Part 0 
Find the gauge and absolute pressures in the balloon and peanut jar shown above, assuming the manometer connected to the balloon uses water whereas the manometer connected to the jar contains mercury. Express in units of centimeters of water for the balloon and millimeters of mercury for the jar, taking (h = 0.0500m)  for each.
