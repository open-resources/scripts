# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A xylem tube is of radius (2.50 times 10^-5 , (m). Verify that such a tube raises sap less than a meter by finding (h) for it, making the same assumptions that sap's density is (1050 , (kg/m^3), its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is (0.0728 , (N/m).
