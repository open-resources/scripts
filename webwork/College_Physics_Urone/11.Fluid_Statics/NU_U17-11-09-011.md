# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
When a person sits erect, increasing the vertical position of their brain by ($h , (cm), the heart must continue to pump blood to the brain at the same rate. The density of blood is equal to (1050 , (kg/m^3). 
## Part 2 
What is the gain in gravitational potential energy for ($V , (mL) of blood raised ($h , (cm)? 
## Part 3 
What is the drop in pressure, neglecting any losses due to friction?
