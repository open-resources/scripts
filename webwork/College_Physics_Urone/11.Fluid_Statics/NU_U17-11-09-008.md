# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If the pressure in the spinal fluid is (10.0 , (mm Hg): 
## Part 2 
What is the reading of the water manometer in (cm H)<sub>2</sub>(O)? 
## Part 3 
What is the reading if the person sits up, placing the top of the fluid ($height , (cm) above the tap? The fluid density is (1.05 , (g/mL). The inital pressure is equal to (1330 , (N/m^2).
