# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Heroes in movies hide beneath water and breathe through a hollow reed (villains never catch on to this trick). In practice, you cannot inhale in this manner if your lungs are more than (60.0 , (cm) below the surface. What is the maximum negative gauge pressure you can create in your lungs on dry land, assuming you can achieve (-$pressure , (cm) water pressure with your lungs (60.0 , (cm) below the surface?
