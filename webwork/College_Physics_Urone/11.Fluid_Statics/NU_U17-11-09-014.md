# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose you hit a steel nail with a (0.500 , (kg) hammer, initially moving at ($speed , (m/s)  and brought to rest in ($d , (mm). The surface tension of steel is (2.10 times 10^11 , (N/m^2). 
## Part 2 
What average force is exerted on the nail? 
## Part 3 
How much is the nail compressed if it is ($diameter) (mm) in diameter and ($long) (cm) long? 
## Part 4 
What pressure is created on the (1.00 , (mm) diameter tip of the nail?
