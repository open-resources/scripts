# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the ratio of the heights to which water and mercury are raised by capillary action in the same glass tube. The surface tension of water is equal to (0.0728 , (N/m). The surface tension of mercury is equal to (0.465 , (N/m). The density of mercury is equal to (13600, (kg/m^3). The contact angle for mercury is (140) degrees.
