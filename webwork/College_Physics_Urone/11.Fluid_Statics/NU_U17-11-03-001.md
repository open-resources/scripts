# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
As a woman walks, her entire weight is momentarily placed on one heel of her high-heeled shoes. Calculate the pressure exerted on the floor by the heel if it has an area of ($area , (cm^3)  and the woman's mass is ($mass , (kg). Express the pressure in (Pa) where (1, (Pa) = (1 , (N/m^2).  (In the early days of commercial flight, women were not allowed to wear high-heeled shoes because aircraft floors were too thin to withstand such large pressures.)
