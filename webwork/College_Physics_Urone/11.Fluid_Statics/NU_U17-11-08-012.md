# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
When two soap bubbles touch, the larger is inflated by the smaller until they form a single bubble. The surface tension for soap is (0.0370 , (N/m). 
## Part 2 
What is the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble with a ($r , (cm) radius? 
## Part 3 
Inside a ($r2 , (cm) radius soap bubble? 
## Part 4 
Inside the single bubble they form if no air is lost when they touch?
