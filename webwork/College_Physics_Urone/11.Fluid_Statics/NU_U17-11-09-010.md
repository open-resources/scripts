# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
During heavy lifting, a disk between spinal vertebrae is subjected to a ($force , (N) compressional force. 
## Part 2 
What pressure is created, assuming that the disk has a uniform circular cross section ($r , (cm) in radius? 
## Part 3 
What deformation is produced if the disk is ($thick , (cm) thick and has a Young's modulus of (1.5 times 10^9 , (N/m^2)?
