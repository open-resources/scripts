# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If the pressure in the esophagus is (-$p1 , (mm Hg) while that in the stomach is (+$p2 , (mm Hg), to what height could stomach fluid rise in the esophagus, assuming a density of (1.10 , (g/mL)? (This movement will not occur if the muscle closing the lower end of the esophagus is working properly.)
