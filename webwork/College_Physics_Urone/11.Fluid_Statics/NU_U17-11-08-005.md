# {{ params.vars.title }}![[Figure]](Figure_12_08_10a.png)

## Part 0 
The figure above shows the effect of tube radius on the height to which capillary action can raise a fluid. 
## Part 1 
(a) Calculate the height  for water in a glass tube with a radius of (0.900 , (cm) a rather large tube like the one on the left. 
## Part 2 
(b) What is the radius of the glass tube on the right if it raises water to (4.00 (cm)?
