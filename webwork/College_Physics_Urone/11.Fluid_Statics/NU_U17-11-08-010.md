# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose water is raised by capillary action to a height of ($r , (cm) in a glass tube. 
## Part 2 
To what height will it be raised in a paraffin tube of the same radius? The paraffin tube has an angle of (107) degrees. 
## Part 3 
In a silver tube of the same radius? The silver tube has an angle of (90) degrees.
