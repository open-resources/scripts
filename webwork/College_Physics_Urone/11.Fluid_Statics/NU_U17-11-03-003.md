# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Nail tips exert tremendous pressures when they are hit by hammers because they exert a large force over a small area. What force must be exerted on a nail with a circular tip of (1.00 , (mm) diameter to create a pressure of ($pressure times 10^9 , (N/m^2) (This high pressure is possible because the hammer striking the nail is brought to rest in such a short distance.)
