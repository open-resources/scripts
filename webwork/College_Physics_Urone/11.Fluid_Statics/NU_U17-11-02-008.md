# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($mass  , (kg) steel gasoline can holds ($volume , (L) of gasoline when full. What is the average density of the full gas can, taking into account the volume occupied by steel as well as by gasoline? The density of gasoline is ( 680 , (kg/m^3). The density of steel is  ( 7800 , (kg/m^3).
