# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the density of  (18.0) -karat gold that is a mixture of ( 18 ) parts gold, ( 5 ) parts silver, and (1)  part copper? (These values are parts by mass, not volume.) Assume that this is a simple mixture having an average density equal to the weighted densities of its constituents. The density of gold is ( 19.32 , (g/cm^3), silver is ( 10.1 , (g/cm^3) and copper is ( 8.8 , (g/cm^3)
