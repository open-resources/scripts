# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A simple compass can be made by placing a small bar magnet on a cork floating in water. 
## Part 2 
What fraction of a plain cork will be submerged when floating in water? The density of cork is (240 , (kg/m^3). 
## Part 3 
 If the cork has a mass of ($mass1 , (g) and a ($mass2 , (g) magnet is placed on it, what fraction of the cork will be submerged? Iron has a density of (7.8 , (g/cm^3).
