# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
There is relatively little empty space between atoms in solids and liquids, so that the average density of an atom is about the same as matter on a macroscopic scaleâ€”approximately (10^3 , (kg/m^3)  . The nucleus of an atom has a radius about (10^-15)  that of the atom and contains nearly all the mass of the entire atom. What is the approximate density of a nucleus? b) One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus. What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun (the radius of the Sun is (7 times 10^8 , (m))? The mass of the sun is equal to (1.99 times 10^30 , (kg).
