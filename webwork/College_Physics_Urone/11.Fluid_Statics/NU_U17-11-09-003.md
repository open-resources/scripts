# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
One way to force air into an unconscious person's lungs is to squeeze on a balloon appropriately connected to the subject. What force must you exert on the balloon with your hands to create a gauge pressure of ($pressure) cm water, assuming you squeeze on an effective area of ($area, (cm^2)? There are (98.1 , (N/m^2) per (1 , (cm) of (H)<sub>2</sub>(O).
