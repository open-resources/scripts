# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What are the SI units of (rho gh)? Express units in the form (m^alpha s^beta kg^gamma), where (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) are integers. 
## Part 2 
(alpha) = ans_rule(10) (beta) = ans_rule(10)(gamma) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 3 
What are the SI units of (N/m^2)? Express units in the form (m^alpha s^beta kg^gamma), where (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) are integers. 
## Part 4 
(alpha) = ans_rule(10) (beta) = ans_rule(10)(gamma) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 5 
Are the SI units of (rho gh) equal to the SI units of (N/m^2). Enter 0 for Yes and enter 1 for No.
