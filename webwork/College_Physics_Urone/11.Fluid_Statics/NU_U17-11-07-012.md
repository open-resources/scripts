# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A certain man has a mass of ($mass , (kg) and a density of ($density , (kg/m^3)  (excluding the air in his lungs). The density of air is (1.29 , (kg/m^3). 
## Part 2 
Calculate his volume. 
## Part 3 
Find the buoyant force air exerts on him. 
## Part 4 
What is the ratio of the buoyant force to his weight?
