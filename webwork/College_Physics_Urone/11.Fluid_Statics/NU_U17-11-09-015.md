# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the pressure due to the ocean at the bottom of the Marianas Trench near the Philippines, given its depth is (11 , (km) and assuming the density of sea water is (1025 , (kg/m^3) and is constant all the way down. There is (1 , (atm) per (101300 , (N/m^2). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the percent decrease in volume of sea water due to such a pressure, assuming its bulk modulus is (2.2 times 10^9 , (N/m^2) and is the same as water and is constant. 
## Part 3 
What would be the ratio of change in density to initial density?
