# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A certain hydraulic system is designed to exert a force ($force) times as large as the one put into it. 
## Part 2 
What must be the ratio of the area of the slave cylinder to the area of the master cylinder? 
## Part 3 
What must be the ratio of their diameters? 
## Part 4 
By what factor is the distance through which the output force moves reduced relative to the distance through which the input force moves? Assume no losses to friction.
