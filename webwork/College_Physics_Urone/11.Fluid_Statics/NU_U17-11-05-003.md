# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A crass host pours the remnants of several bottles of wine into a jug after a party. He then inserts a cork with a ($d1 , (cm) diameter into the bottle, placing it in direct contact with the wine. He is amazed when he pounds the cork into place and the bottom of the jug (with a ($d2 , (cm) diameter) breaks away. Calculate the extra force exerted against the bottom if he pounded the cork with a ($force , (N) force.
