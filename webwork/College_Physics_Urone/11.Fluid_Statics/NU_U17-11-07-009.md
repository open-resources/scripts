# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Some fish have a density slightly less than that of water and must exert a force (swim) to stay submerged. What force must an ($mass , (kg) grouper exert to stay submerged in salt water if its body density is ($density , (kg/m^3)? Salt water has a density of (1025 , (kg/m^3).
