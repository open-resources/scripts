# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A submarine is stranded on the bottom of the ocean with its hatch ($hatch , (m) below the surface. Calculate the force needed to open the hatch from the inside, given it is circular and ($d , (m) in diameter. Air pressure inside the submarine is (1.00 , (atm). The density of salt water is (1025 , (kg/m^3).
