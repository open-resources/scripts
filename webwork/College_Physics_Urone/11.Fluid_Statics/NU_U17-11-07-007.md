# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Archimedes' principle can be used to calculate the density of a fluid as well as that of a solid. Suppose a chunk of iron with a mass of ($mass , (g) in air is found to have an apparent mass of ($mass2 , (g) when completely submerged in an unknown liquid. 
## Part 2 
What mass of fluid does the iron displace? 
## Part 3 
What is the volume of iron, using its density of (7.8 , (g/cm^3). 
## Part 4 
Calculate the fluid's density.
