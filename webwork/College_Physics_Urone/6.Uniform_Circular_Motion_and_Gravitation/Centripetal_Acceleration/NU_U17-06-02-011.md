# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
At takeoff, a commercial jet has a ($velocitySI) (m/s) speed. Its tires have a diameter of ($diameterSI) (m). 
## Part 1 
Through how many revolutions do the tires rotate each minute? 
## Part 2 
What is the centripetal acceleration at the edge of the tire? 
## Part 3 
With what force must a ($mass_bacterium times 10^-15) (kg) bacterium cling to the rim of a tire? 
## Part 4 
Find the ratio of this this force to the bacterium's weight.
