# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The propeller of a World War II fighter plane is ($propeller_diameterSI) (m) in diameter. 
## Part 1 
What is its angular velocity in radians per second if it spins at ($rpm) (rpm)? 
## Part 2 
What is the linear speed of its tip at this angular velocity if the plane is stationary on the tarmac? 
## Part 3 
What is the centripetal acceleration of the propeller tip under these conditions? Calculate it in multiples of (g).
