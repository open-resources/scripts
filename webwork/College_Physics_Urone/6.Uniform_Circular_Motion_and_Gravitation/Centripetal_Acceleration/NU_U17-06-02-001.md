# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A fairground ride spins its occupants inside a flying saucer-shaped container. If the horizontal circular path the riders follow has an ($radiusSI) (m) radius, at how many revolutions per minute will the riders be subjected to a centripetal acceleration ($n) times that due to gravity?
