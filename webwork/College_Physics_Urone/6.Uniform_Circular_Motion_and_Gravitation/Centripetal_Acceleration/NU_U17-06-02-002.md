# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A runner taking part in the ($distanceSI) (m) dash must run around the end of a track that has a circular arc with a radius of curvature of ($radiusSI) (m). If he completes the ($distanceSI) (m) dash in ($timeSI) (s) and runs at constant speed throughout the race, what is his centripetal acceleration as he runs the curved portion of the track?
