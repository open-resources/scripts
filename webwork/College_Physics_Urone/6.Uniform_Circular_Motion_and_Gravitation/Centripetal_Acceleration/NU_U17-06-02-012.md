# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Riders in an amusement park ride shaped like a Viking ship hung from a large pivot are rotated back and forth like a rigid pendulum. Sometime near the middle of the ride, the ship is momentarily motionless at the top of its circular arc. The ship then swings down under the influence of gravity. 
## Part 1 
Assuming negligible friction, find the speed of the riders at the bottom of its arc, given the system's center of mass travels in an arc having a radius of ($radiusSI) (m) and the riders are near the center of mass. 
## Part 2 
What is the centripetal acceleration at the bottom of the arc? 
## Part 3 
Find the force exerted by the ride on a ($rider_massSI) (kg) rider.
