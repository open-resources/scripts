# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A mother pushes her child on a swing so that his speed is ($velocitySI) (m/s) at the lowest point of his path. The swing is suspended ($radiusSI) (m) above the child's center of mass. 
## Part 1 
What is the centripetal acceleration of the child at the low point? 
## Part 2 
What force does the child exert on the seat if his mass is ($child_massSI) (kg)?
