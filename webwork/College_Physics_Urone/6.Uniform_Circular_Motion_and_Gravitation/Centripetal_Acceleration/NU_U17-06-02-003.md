# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Taking the age of Earth to be about  (4 times 10^9) years and assuming its orbital radius of  (1.5 times 10^11) (m) has not changed and is circular, calculate the approximate total distance Earth has traveled since its birth (in a frame of reference stationary with respect to the Sun).
