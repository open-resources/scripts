# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Helicopter blades withstand tremendous stresses. In addition to supporting the weight of a helicopter, they are spun at rapid rates and experience large centripetal accelerations, especially at the tip. Calculate the centripetal acceleration at the tip of a ($blade_lengthSI) (m) long helicopter blade that rotates at ($rpm) (rpm).
