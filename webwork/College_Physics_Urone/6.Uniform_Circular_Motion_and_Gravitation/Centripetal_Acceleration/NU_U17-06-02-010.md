# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A rotating space station is said to create “artificial gravity”—a loosely-defined term used for an acceleration that would be crudely similar to gravity. The outer wall of the rotating space station would become a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor would allow astronauts to exercise and maintain muscle and bone strength more naturally than in non-rotating space environments. If the space station is ($diameterSI) (m) in diameter, what angular velocity would produce an “artificial gravity” of  ($g) (m/s^2) at the rim?
