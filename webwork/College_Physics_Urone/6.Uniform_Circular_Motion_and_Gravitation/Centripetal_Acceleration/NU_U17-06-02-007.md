# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Olympic ice skaters are able to spin at about ($rps_skaters) (rev/s). 
## Part 1 
What is their angular velocity in radians per second? 
## Part 2 
What is the centripetal acceleration of the skater's nose if it is ($radiusSI) (m) from the axis of rotation? 
## Part 3 
An exceptional skater named Dick Button was able to spin much faster in the 1950s than anyone sinceâ€”at about ($rps_DB) (rev/s). What was the centripetal acceleration of the tip of his nose, assuming it is at ($radiusSI) (m) radius?
