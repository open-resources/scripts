# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Sun. Take the mass of Sun and its radius to be (1.989 times 10^30) (kg) and (6.955 times 10^5) (km). 
## Part 1 
By what factor would your weight increase if you could stand on the Sun? (Never mind that you cannot.)
