# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon? Take the mass of the Moon and its radius to be (7.348 times 10^22) (kg) and (1.737 times 10^3) (km), respectively. 
## Part 1 
On the surface of Mars? Take the mass of Mars and its radius to be (6.418 times 10^23) (kg) and (3.390 times 10^3) (km), respectively.
