# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A mountain ($radius) (km) from a person exerts a gravitational force on him equal to ($percent)(%) of his weight. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the mass of the mountain. 
## Part 2 
Compare the mountain's mass with that of Earth, taking the mass of the Earth to be (5.972times10^24).
