# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The Sun orbits the Milky Way galaxy once each (2.60 times 10^8) years, with a roughly circular orbit averaging (3.00 times 10^4) light years in radius. (A light year is the distance traveled by light in one year.) 
## Part 1 
Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the Sun in its galactic orbit. Does your result support thecontention that a nearly inertial frame of reference can be located at the Sun? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the average speed of the Sun in its galactic orbit. Does the answer surprise you?
