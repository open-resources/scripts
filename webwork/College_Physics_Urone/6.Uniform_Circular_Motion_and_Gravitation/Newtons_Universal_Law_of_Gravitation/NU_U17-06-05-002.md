# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth due to the Moon. Take the mass of the Moon and the distance separating the Earth and Moon to be (7.348 times 10^22) (kg) and (3.844 times 10^5) (km), respectively. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth due to the Sun. Take the mass of the Sun and the distance separating the Earth and Sun to be (1.989 times 10^30) (kg) and (1.496 times 10^8) (km), respectively.
