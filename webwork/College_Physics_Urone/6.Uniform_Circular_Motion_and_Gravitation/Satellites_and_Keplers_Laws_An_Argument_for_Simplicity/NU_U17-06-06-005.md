# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Astronomical observations of or Milky Way galaxy indicate that it has a mass of about ($mmwtimes 10^11) solar masses. A star orbiting the galaxy's periphery is about ($ds times 10^4) light years from its center. 
## Part 2 
What should the orbital period of the star be? 
## Part 3 
If its period is ($Tstimes 10^7) instead, what is the mass of the galaxy? 
## Part 4 
Such calculations are used to imply the existence of "dark matter" in the universe and have indicated, for example, the existence of very massive black holes at the centers of some galaxies.
