$BBOLDIf you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.$EBOLD 
## Part 2 
Space debris left from old satellites and their launchers is becoming a hazard to other satellites. 
## Part 3 
Calculate the speed of a satellite in an orbit ($hkm,km) above Earth's surface. 
## Part 4 
Suppose a loose rivet is in an orbit of the same radius that intersects the satellite's orbit at an angle of (90^circ) relative to Earth. What is the velocity of the rivet relative to the satellite just before striking it? 
## Part 5 
If its mass is ($mg,g), what is the average force it exerts on the satellite? 
## Part 6 
How much energy in joules is generated by the collision? (The satellite's velocity does not change appreciably, because its mass is much greater than the rivet's.)
