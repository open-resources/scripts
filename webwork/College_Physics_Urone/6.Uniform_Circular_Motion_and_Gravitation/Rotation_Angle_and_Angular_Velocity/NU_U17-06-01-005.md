# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A baseball pitcher brings his arm forward during a pitch, rotating the forearm about the elbow. If the velocity of the ball in the pitcher's hand is ($velocitySI) (m/s) and the ball is ($arm_radiusSI) (m) from the elbow joint, what is the angular velocity of the forearm?
