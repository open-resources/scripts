# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In lacrosse, a ball is thrown from a net on the end of a stick by rotating the stick and forearm about the elbow. If the angular velocity of the ball about the elbow joint is ($omegaSI) (rad/s) and the ball is ($stick_radiusSI) (m) from the elbow joint, what is the linear velocity of the ball?
