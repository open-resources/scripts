# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> When kicking a football, the kicker rotates his leg about the hip joint. 
## Part 1 
If the velocity of the tip of the kicker's shoe is ($velocity_shoeSI) (m/s) and the hip joint is ($leg_radiusSI) (m) from the tip of the shoe, what is the shoe tip's angular velocity? 
## Part 2 
The shoe is in contact with the initially nearly stationary ($ball_massSI) (kg) football for ($impulse_time) (ms). What average force is exerted on the football to give it a velocity of ($velocity_ballSI) (m/s)? 
## Part 3 
Find the maximum range of the football, neglecting air resistance.
