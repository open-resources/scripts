# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Semi-trailer trucks have an odometer on one hub of a trailer wheel. The hub is weighted so that it does not rotate, but it contains gears to count the number of wheel revolutionsâ€”it then calculates the distance traveled. If the wheel has a ($wheel_diameterSI) (m) diameter and goes through ($wheel_rotations times 10^5) revolutions, how many kilometers should the odometer read?
