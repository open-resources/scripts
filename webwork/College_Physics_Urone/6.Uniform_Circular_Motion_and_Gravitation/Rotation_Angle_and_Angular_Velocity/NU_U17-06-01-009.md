<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Consider an amusement park ride in which participants are rotated about a vertical axis in a ($radiusSI)-(m) radius cylinder with vertical walls. Calculate the minimum angular velocity that assures the riders will not slide down the wall once the floor drops away. Take the coefficient of static friction between the riders' clothes and the walls to be ($mu).
