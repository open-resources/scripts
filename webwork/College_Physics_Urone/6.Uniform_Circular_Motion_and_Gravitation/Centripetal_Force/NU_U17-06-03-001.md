# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($child_massSI) (kg) child is riding a playground merry-go-round that is rotating at ($rpm_a) (rpm). What force must she exert to stay on if she is ($radius_aSI) m from its center? 
## Part 1 
What centripetal force does she need to stay on an amusement park merry-go-round that rotates at ($rpm_b) (rpm) if she is ($radius_bSI) (m) from its center?
