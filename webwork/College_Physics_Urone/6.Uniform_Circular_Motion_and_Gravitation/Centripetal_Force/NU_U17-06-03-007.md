## Part 0 
A large centrifuge, like the one shown in Figure (a) above, is used to expose aspiring astronauts to accelerations similar to those experienced in rocket launches and atmospheric reentries. 
## Part 1 
At what angular velocity is the centripetal acceleration ($n)(g) if the rider is ($radiusSI) (m) from the center of rotation? 
## Part 2 
The rider's cage hangs on a pivot at the end of the arm, allowing it to swing outward during rotation as shown in Figure (b) above. At what angle below the horizontal will the cage hang when the centripetal acceleration is ($n)(g)?
