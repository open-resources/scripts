## Part 0 
Part of riding a bicycle involves leaning at the correct angle when making a turn, as seen in the figure above. To be stable, the force exerted by the ground must be on a line going through the center of gravity. The force on the bicycle wheel can be resolved into two perpendicular componentsâ€”friction parallel to the road and the vertical normal force. 
## Part 1 
Calculate <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";><i>&theta;</i></span> (as defined in the figure) for a ($radiusSI)-(m) radius turn taken at ($velocitySI) (m/s).
