# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> If a car takes a banked curve at less than the ideal speed, friction is needed to keep it from sliding toward the inside of the curve (a real problem on icy mountain roads). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the ideal speed to take a ($radiusSI) (m) radius curve banked at ($theta_degrees^circ). 
## Part 2 
What is the minimum coefficient of friction needed for a frightened driver to take the same curve at ($velocitySI) (m/s)?
