# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A car of mass (1200) kg moves around a circular curve of radius (300) m at a constant speed of (28) m/s. The curved road is on level ground. $BR 
## Part 2 
(a) Determine the magnitude of the car's acceleration. $BR ans_rule(20)  m/s<sup>2</sup> 
## Part 3 
(b) Determine the magnitude of the frictional force that the road must exert on the car to keep it turning in its circular path.  $BR ans_rule(20)  N 
## Part 4 
(c) Because the car does not slide sideways as it moves, it is static friction that provides the force that keeps the car moving in a circular path. Determine the minimum coefficient of static friction between the road and the car.  $BR ans_rule(20)
