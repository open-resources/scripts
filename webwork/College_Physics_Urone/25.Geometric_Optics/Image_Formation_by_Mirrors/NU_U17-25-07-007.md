# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An object ($object_height) (cm) high is held ($object_distanceSI) (m) from a person's cornea, and its reflected image is measured to be ($image_height) (cm) high. 
## Part 1 
What is the magnification? 
## Part 2 
Where is the image? 
## Part 3 
Find the radius of curvature of the convex mirror formed by the cornea.
