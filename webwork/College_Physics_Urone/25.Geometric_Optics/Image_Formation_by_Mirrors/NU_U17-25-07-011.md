<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Calculate the intensity of infrared radiation projected by the concave mirror of an electric heater on a person ($image_distanceSI) (m) away. Assume that the mirror has a radius of curvature of ($radius_of_curvature) (cm), the heating element radiates ($powerSI) (W) and has an area of ($surface_area_1) (cm^2), and that half of the radiated power is reflected and focused by the mirror.
