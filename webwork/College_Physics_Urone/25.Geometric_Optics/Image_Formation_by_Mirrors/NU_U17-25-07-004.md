# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An electric room heater uses a concave mirror to reflect infrared radiation from hot coils. Note that IR follows the same law of reflection as visible light. Find its magnification, given that the mirror has a radius of curvature of ($radius_of_curvature) (cm) and produces an image of the coils ($image_distanceSI) (m) away from the mirror.
