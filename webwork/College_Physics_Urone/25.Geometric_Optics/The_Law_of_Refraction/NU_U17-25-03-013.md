# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Suppose light travels from water to another substance, with an angle of incidence of ($theta_water_degrees^circ) and an angle of refraction of  ($theta_unknown_degrees^circ). What is the index of refraction of the other substance? Water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_water).
