# {{ params.vars.title }}![Ray Diagram](NU_U17-25-03-011.png)

## Part 0 
Suppose the figure above represents a ray of light going from air through crown glass into water, such as going into a fish tank. Calculate the amount the ray is displaced by the glass, <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";><i>&Delta;x</i></span>, given that the incident angle is ($theta_1_degrees^circ) and the glass is ($thickness) (cm) thick. Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to ($n_glass).
