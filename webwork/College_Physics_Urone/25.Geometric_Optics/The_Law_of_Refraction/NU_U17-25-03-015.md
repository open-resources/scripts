# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> Light traveling from water to a gemstone strikes the surface at an angle of  ($theta_water_degrees^circ)  and has an angle of refraction of ($theta_gemstone_degrees^circ). What is the speed of light in the gemstone? Water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_water).
