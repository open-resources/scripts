# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have an unknown clear substance immersed in water, and you wish to identify it by finding its index of refraction. You arrange to have a beam of light enter it at an angle of  ($theta_water_degrees^circ), and you observe the angle of refraction to be ($theta_unknown_degrees^circ). What is the index of refraction of the substance? Water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_water).
