# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
There was a major collision of an asteroid with the Moon in medieval times. It was described by monks at Canterbury Cathedral in England as a red glow on and around the Moon. How long after the asteroid hit the Moon, which is ($moon_distance times 10^5) (km)  away, would the light first arrive on Earth?
