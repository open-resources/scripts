# {{ params.vars.title }}![Ray Diagram](NU_U17-25-03-008.png)

## Part 0 
Given that the angle between the ray in the water and the perpendicular to the water is ($theta_water_degrees^circ), and using information in the figure above, find the height of the instructor's head above the water. Water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_water). 
## Part 1 
Find the apparent depth of the diver's head below water as seen by the instructor.
