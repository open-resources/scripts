## Part 0 
A light ray entering an optical fiber made from crown glass and surrounded by air is first refracted and then reflected as shown in the figure above. Enter, in interval notation, using the appropriate brackets and without spaces, the set of incident angles <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";><i>&theta;</i><sub>1<sub></span> for which the fiber undergoes total internal reflection.
