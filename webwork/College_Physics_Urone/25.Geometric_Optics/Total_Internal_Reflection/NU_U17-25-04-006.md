# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
You can determine the index of refraction of a substance by determining its critical angle. 
## Part 1 
What is the index of refraction of a substance that has a critical angle of ($critical_angle_water_degrees^circ) when submerged in water? Water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_water). 
## Part 2 
What would the critical angle be for this substance in air?
