# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you are using total internal reflection to make an efficient corner reflector. If there is air outside and the incident angle is ($critical_angle_degrees^circ), what must be the minimum index of refraction of the material from which the reflector is made? The index of refraction for air is equal to ($n_air).
