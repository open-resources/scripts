# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the ratio of the speed of red light to violet light in diamond? The index of refraction for the violet light in diamond is ($n_violet_diamond) and the red light is ($n_red_diamond). 
## Part 1 
What is this ratio in polystyrene? Violet light has an index of refraction equal to ($n_violet_polystyrene) and red light has a value of ($n_red_polystyrene).
