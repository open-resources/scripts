# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A narrow beam of light containing (660) (nm) red and (470) (nm) blue wavelengths travels from air through a ($thickness) (cm) thick flat piece of crown glass and back to air again. The beam strikes at a ($theta_incident_degrees^circ) incident angle. The index of refraction in crown glass for red light is ($n_red) and for blue light is ($n_blue). 
## Part 1 
At what angles do the two colors emerge? 
## Part 2 
Red = ans_rule(40) &#176; 
## Part 3 
Blue = ans_rule(40) &#176; 
## Part 4 
By what distance are the red and blue separated when they emerge?
