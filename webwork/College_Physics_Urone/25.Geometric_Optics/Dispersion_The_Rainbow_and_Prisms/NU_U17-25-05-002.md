# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A beam of white light goes from air into water at an incident angle of ($theta_incident_degrees^circ). At what angles are the red (660) (nm) and violet (410) (nm) parts of the light refracted? Red light in water has an index of refraction equal to ($n_red) and that of violet light is ($n_violet). 
## Part 1 
Red = ans_rule(40) &#176; 
## Part 2 
Violet = ans_rule(40) &#176;
