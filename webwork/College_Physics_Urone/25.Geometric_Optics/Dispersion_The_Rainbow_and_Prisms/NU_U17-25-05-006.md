# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ray of (610) (nm) orange light goes from air into fused quartz at an incident angle of ($theta_incident_orange_degrees^circ). At what incident angle must (470) (nm) blue light enter flint glass to have the same angle of refraction? The index of refraction in fused quartz for orange light is ($n_orange_quartz) and for blue light in flint glass is ($n_blue_glass).
