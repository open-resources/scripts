# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A parallel beam of light containing orange (610) (nm) and violet (410) (nm) wavelengths goes from fused quartz to water, striking the surface between them at a ($theta_incident_degrees^circ) incident angle. What is the angle between the two colors in water? The index of refraction in fused quartz for orange light is ($n_orange_quartz) and violet light is ($n_violet_quartz). The index of refraction in water for orange light is ($n_orange_water) and violet light is ($n_violet_water).
