# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A camera with a ($focal_length) (mm) focal length lens is being used to photograph a person standing ($object_distanceSI) (m) away. 
## Part 1 
How far from the lens must the film be? 
## Part 2 
If the film is ($film_height) (mm) high, how tall a person will fit on it?
