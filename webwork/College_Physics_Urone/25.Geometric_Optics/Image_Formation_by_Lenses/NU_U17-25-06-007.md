# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A doctor examines a mole with a ($focal_length) (cm) focal length magnifying glass held ($object_distance) (cm) from the mole. 
## Part 1 
Where is the image? 
## Part 2 
What is its magnification? 
## Part 3 
How big is the image of a ($diameter_mole) (mm) diameter mole?
