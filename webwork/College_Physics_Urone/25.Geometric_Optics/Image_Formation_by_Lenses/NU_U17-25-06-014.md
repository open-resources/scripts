# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A magnifying glass was found to have a focal length of ($focal_length) (cm). 
## Part 1 
Find the magnification for the book when it is held ($object_distance_a) (cm) from the magnifier. 
## Part 2 
Do the same for when it is held ($object_distance_b) (cm) from the magnifier.
