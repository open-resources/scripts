# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A certain slide projector has a ($focal_length) (mm) focal length lens. 
## Part 1 
How far away is the screen, if a slide is placed ($object_distance) (mm) from the lens and produces a sharp image? 
## Part 2 
If the slide is ($slide_length) (mm) long by ($slide_width) (mm) wide, what are the dimensions of the image? 
## Part 3 
Length = ans_rule(20) (cm)
