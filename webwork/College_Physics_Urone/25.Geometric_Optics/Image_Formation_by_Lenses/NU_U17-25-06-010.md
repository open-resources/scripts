# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A camera lens used for taking close-up photographs has a focal length of ($focal_length) (mm). The farthest it can be placed from the film is ($image_distance) (mm). 
## Part 1 
What is the closest object that can be photographed? 
## Part 2 
What is the magnification of this closest object?
