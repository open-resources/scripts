# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A car advertisement claims that its ($m-kg) car accelerated from rest to ($v, m/s) and drove ($dkm, km), gaining ($hkm, km) in altitude, on (1.0, gal) of gasoline ((1.2 times 10^8, J)). The average force of friction including air resistance was ($Ff, N). Assume all values are known to three significant figures. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the car's efficiency. 
## Part 2 
Does this seem reasonable?
