# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Unreasonable Results.  Body fat is metabolized, supplying ($kJg, kJ/g), when dietary intake is less than needed to fuel metabolism. The manufacturers of an exercise bicycle claim that you can lose ($mkg, kg) of fat per day by vigorously exercising for ($hour, h) per day on their machine. 
## Part 1 
How many (kJ) are supplied by the metabolization of ($mkg, kg) of fat? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the (kJ/min) that you would have to utilize to metabolize fat at the rate of ($mkg, kg) in ($hour, h).
