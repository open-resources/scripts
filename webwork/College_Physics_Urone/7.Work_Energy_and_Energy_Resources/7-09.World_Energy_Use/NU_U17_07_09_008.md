# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m-kg) basketball player crouches down ($d, m) while waiting to jump. After exerting a force on the floor through this ($d, m), his feet leave the floor and his centre of gravity rises ($h, m) above its normal standing erect position. 
## Part 1 
Using energy considerations, calculate his speed when he leaves the floor. 
## Part 2 
What average force did he exert on the floor? (Do not neglect the force to support his weight as well as that to accelerate him.) 
## Part 3 
What was his power output during the acceleration phase?
