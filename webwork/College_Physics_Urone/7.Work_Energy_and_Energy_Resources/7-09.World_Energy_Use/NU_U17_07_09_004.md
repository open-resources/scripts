# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A toy gun uses a spring with a force constant of ($k, N/m) to propel a ($mg-g) steel ball. If the spring is compressed ($xcm, cm) and friction is negligible: 
## Part 1 
How much force is needed to compress the spring? 
## Part 2 
To what maximum height can the ball be shot? 
## Part 3 
At what angles above the horizontal may a child aim to hit a target ($R, m) away at the same height as the gun? 
## Part 4 
larger angle = ans_rule(40) (degrees)ANS(num_cmp("$degree"));ANS(num_cmp("$degree2")); 
## Part 5 
What is the gun's maximum range on level ground?
