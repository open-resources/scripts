# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What force must be supplied by an elevator cable to produce an acceleration of ($a, m/s^2) against a ($Ff-N) frictional force, if the mass of the loaded elevator is ($m, kg)? 
## Part 1 
How much work is done by the cable in lifting the elevator ($d, m)? 
## Part 2 
What is the final speed of the elevator if it starts from rest? 
## Part 3 
How much work went into thermal energy?
