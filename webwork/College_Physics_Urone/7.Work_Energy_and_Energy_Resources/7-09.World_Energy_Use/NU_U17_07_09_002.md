# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: A ($m-kg) cross-country skier is climbing a ($degree^circ) slope at a constant speed of ($vo, m/s) and encounters air resistance of ($f, N). 
## Part 1 
Find his power output for work done against the gravitational force and air resistance. 
## Part 2 
What average force does he exert backward on the snow to accomplish this? 
## Part 3 
If he continues to exert this force and to experience the same air resistance when he reaches a level area, how long will it take him to reach a velocity of ($v, m/s)?
