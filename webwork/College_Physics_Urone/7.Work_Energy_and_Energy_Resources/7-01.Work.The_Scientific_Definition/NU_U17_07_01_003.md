# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the work done on a ($m, (kg) elevator compartment by its cable to lift it ($h, (m) at constant speed, assuming friction averages ($F, (N). 
## Part 1 
What is the work done on the elevator compartment by the gravitational force in this process? 
## Part 2 
What is the total work done on the elevator compartment?
