# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a car travels ($km, km) at a speed of ($v, m/s), and uses ($gal, gal) of gasoline. Only ($percent,  %) of the gasoline goes into useful work by the force that keeps the car moving at constant speed despite friction. (The energy content of gasoline is (1.2 times 10^8, J/gal).) 
## Part 1 
What is the force exerted to keep the car moving at constant speed? 
## Part 2 
If the required force is directly proportional to speed, how many gallons of gasoline will be used to drive ($km, km) at a speed of ($v1, m/s)?
