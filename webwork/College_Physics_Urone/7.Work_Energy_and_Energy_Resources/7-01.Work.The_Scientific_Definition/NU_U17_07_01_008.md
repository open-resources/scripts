# {{ params.vars.title }}![Rescue Sled.](NU_U17_07_01_008.png)

## Part 0 
Suppose the ski patrol lowers a rescue sled and victim, having a total mass of ($m, kg), down a ($degree^circ) slope at constant speed, as shown above. The coefficient of friction between the sled and the snow is ($us). 
## Part 1 
How much work is done by friction as the sled moves ($d, m) along the hill? 
## Part 2 
How much work is done by the rope on the sled in this distance? 
## Part 3 
What is the work done by the gravitational force on the sled? 
## Part 4 
What is the total work done?
