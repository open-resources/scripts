# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the work done by a ($m, kg) man who pushes a crate ($d, m) up along a ramp that makes an angle of ($degree^circ) with the horizontal. He exerts a force of ($F, N) on the crate parallel to the ramp and moves at a constant speed. 
## Part 1 
Be certain to include the work he does on the crate and on his body to get up the ramp.
