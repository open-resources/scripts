# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A shopper pushes a grocery cart ($d, m) at constant speed on level ground, against a ($F, N) frictional force. He pushes in a direction ($degree^circ) below the horizontal. 
## Part 1 
What is the work done on the cart by friction? 
## Part 2 
What is the work done on the cart by the gravitational force? 
## Part 3 
What is the work done on the cart by the shopper? 
## Part 4 
Find the force the shopper exerts, using energy considerations 
## Part 5 
What is the total work done on the cart?
