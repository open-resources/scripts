# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Knowing that (10^-19, J) are required to break one molecule of DNA and that a single electron emitted by a TV tube carries (4.0 times 10^-15, J), how many DNA molecules could be broken by the energy carried by a single electron in the beam of an old-fashioned TV tube? (These electrons were not dangerous in themselves, but they did create dangerous X-rays. Later model tube TVs had shielding that absorbed X-rays before they escaped and exposed viewers.)
