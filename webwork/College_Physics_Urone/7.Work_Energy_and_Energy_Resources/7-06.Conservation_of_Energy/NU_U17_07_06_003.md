# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If the energy in fusion bombs were used to supply the energy needs of the world, how many of the 9-megaton variety would be needed for a year's supply of energy, given that annual world energy use is (4 times 10^20, J) and that a 9-megaton fusion bomb releases (3.8 times 10^16, J)? This is not as far-fetched as it may soundâ€”there are thousands of nuclear bombs, and their energy can be trapped in underground explosions and converted to electricity, as natural geothermal energy is.
