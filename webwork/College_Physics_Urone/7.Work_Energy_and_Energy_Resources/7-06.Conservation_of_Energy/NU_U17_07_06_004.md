# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The use of hydrogen fusion to supply energy is a dream that may be realized some day. Fusion would be a relatively clean and almost limitless source of energy. To illustrate this, calculate how many years the energy needs of the world (currently about (4.0 times 10^20, J) per year) could be supplied by fusing one millionth of the oceans' hydrogen given that the fusion of all hydrogen in the oceans would release (10^34, J) of energy.
