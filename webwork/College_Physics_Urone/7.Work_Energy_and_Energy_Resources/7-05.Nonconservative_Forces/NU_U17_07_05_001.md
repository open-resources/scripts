# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m, kg) skier with an initial speed of ($vo, m/s) coasts up a straight slope. The slope makes an angle of ($degree^circ) relative to the horizontal, and once the skier reaches the top of the slope her altitude is ($h, m) higher than it was at ground level. Find her final speed at the top, given that the coefficient of friction between her skis and the snow is (0.0800).
