# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How high a hill can a car coast up (engine disengaged) if work done by friction isnegligible and its initial speed is ($vokmh, km/h)? 
## Part 1 
If, in actuality, a ($m, kg) car with an initial speed of ($vokmh, km/h) is observed to coast up a hill to a height ($h, m) above its starting point, how much thermal energy was generated by friction? 
## Part 2 
What is the average force of friction if the hill has a slope ($degree ^circ) above the horizontal?
