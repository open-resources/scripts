# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Boxing gloves are padded to lessen the force of a blow. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force exerted by a boxing glove on an opponent's face, if the glove and face compress ($dacm, cm) during a blow in which the ($m, kg) arm and glove are brought to rest from an initial speed of ($v, m/s). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the force exerted by an identical blow in the gory old days when no gloves were used and the knuckles and face would compress only ($dbcm, cm).
