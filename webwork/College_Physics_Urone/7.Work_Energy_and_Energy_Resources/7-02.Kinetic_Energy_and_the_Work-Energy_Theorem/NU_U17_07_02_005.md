# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A car's bumper is designed to withstand a (4.0, km/h) ((1.12, m/s)) collision with an immovable object without damage to the body of the car. The bumper cushions the shock by absorbing the force over a distance that is greater than it would be without the bumper. Calculate the magnitude of the average force on a bumper that collapses ($d, m) while bringing a ($m, kg) car to rest from an initial speed of (1.12, m/s).
