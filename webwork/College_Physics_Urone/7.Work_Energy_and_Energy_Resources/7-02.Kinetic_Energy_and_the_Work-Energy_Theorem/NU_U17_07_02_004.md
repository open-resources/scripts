# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the magnitude of the force needed to bring a ($m, kg) car to rest from a speed of ($vkmh, km/h) in a distance of ($da, m) (a fairly typical distance for a non-panic stop). 
## Part 1 
Suppose instead the car hits a concrete abutment at full speed and is brought to a stop in ($db, m). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted on the car and compare it with the force found in part (a). 
## Part 3 
Ratio of second force to first force = ans_rule(40)
