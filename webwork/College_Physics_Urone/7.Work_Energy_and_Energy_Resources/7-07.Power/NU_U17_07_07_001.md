# {{ params.vars.title }}![Crab Nebula.](NU_U17_07_07_001.png)

## Part 0 
The Crab Nebula (pictured above) is the remnant of a supernova that occurred in A.D. 1054. The pulsar within the Crab Nebula has a power output of (10^28, W). The power output of a supernova is (5 times 10^37, W) at its peak. Calculate the approximate factor by which the power output of this astronomical object has changed since its explosion.
