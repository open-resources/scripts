# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Find the useful power output of an elevator motor that lifts a ($m1-kg) load a height of ($h, m) in ($t, s), if it also increases the speed from rest to ($v, m/s). Note that the total mass of the counterbalanced system is ($m2, kg), so that only ($m1, kg) is raised in height, but the full ($m2, kg) is accelerated. 
## Part 1 
What does it cost, if electricity is $($money) per kW.h?
