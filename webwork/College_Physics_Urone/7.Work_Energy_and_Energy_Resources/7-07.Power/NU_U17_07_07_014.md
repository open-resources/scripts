# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the power per square meter reaching Earth's upper atmosphere from the Sun. (Take the power output of the Sun to be (4.00 times 10^26, W) and the distance from the Sun to the Earth is (1.5times10^11, m)). 
## Part 1 
Part of this is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere, so that a maximum of (1.30, kW/m^2) reaches Earth's surface. Calculate the area of solar energy collectors needed to replace an electric power plant that generates (750, MW) if the collectors convert an average of (2.00,%) of the maximum power into electricity. (This small conversion efficiency is due to the devices themselves, and the fact that the sun is directly overhead only briefly.) 
## Part 2 
With the same assumptions, what area would be needed to meet the United States' energy needs (1.05 times 10^20, J/y)? 
## Part 3 
Australia's energy needs (5.4 times 10^26, J/y)? 
## Part 4 
China's energy needs (6.3 times 10^26, J/y)?
