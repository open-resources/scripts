# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the available energy content, in joules, of a battery that operates a ($Pa.00,-W) electric clock for ($months) months? 
## Part 1 
How long can a battery that can supply ($Eb.00 times 10^4, J) run a pocket calculator that consumes energy at the rate of ($Pb.00 times 10^-3, W)?
