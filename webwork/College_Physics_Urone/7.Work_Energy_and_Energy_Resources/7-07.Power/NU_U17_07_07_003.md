# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A person in good physical condition can deliver ($Po, W) of useful power for several hours at a stretch, perhaps by pedalling a mechanism that drives an electric generator. Neglect any losses due to generator inefficiency and practical considerations such as resting time. 
## Part 1 
How many people would it take to run a ($PakW, -kW) electric clothes dryer? 
## Part 2 
How many people would it take to replace a large electric power plant that generates ($PbMW, MW)?
