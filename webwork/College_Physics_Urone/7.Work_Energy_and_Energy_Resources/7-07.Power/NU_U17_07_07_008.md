# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m, -kg) dragster accelerates from rest to a final speed of ($v, m/s) in ($d, m) and encounters an average frictional force of ($f, N). What is its average power output in watts if this takes ($t, s)? 
## Part 1 
What is its average power output in horsepower? (Note that 1 hp = 746 W.)
