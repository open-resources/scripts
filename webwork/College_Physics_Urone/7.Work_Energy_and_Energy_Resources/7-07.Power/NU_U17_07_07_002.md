# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a star (1000) times brighter than our Sun (that is, emitting (1000) times the power of our (4 times 10^26, W) sun) suddenly goes supernova, given that the peak power output of a supernova is (5 times 10^37, W), by what factor does its power output change?
