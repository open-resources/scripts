# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the average useful power output of a person who does ($Wa times 10^6, J) of useful work in ($hour, h)? 
## Part 1 
Working at this rate, how long will it take this person to lift ($m, kg) of bricks ($h, m) to a platform? (Work done to lift his body can be omitted because it is not considered useful output here.)
