# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Jogging on hard surfaces with insufficiently padded shoes produces large forces in the feet and legs. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force needed to stop the downward motion of a jogger's leg, if his leg has a mass of ($ml, kg), a speed of ($v, m/s), and stops in a distance of ($dcm, cm). (Be certain to include the weight of the ($mj-kg) jogger's body.) 
## Part 2 
Determine the ratio of this force to the weight of the jogger.
