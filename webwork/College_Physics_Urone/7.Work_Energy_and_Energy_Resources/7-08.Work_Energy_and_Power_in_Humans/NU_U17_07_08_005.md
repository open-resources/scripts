# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Energy that is not utilized for work or heat transfer is converted to the chemical energy of body fat containing about (39, kJ/g). How many grams of fat will you gain if you eat (10,000, kJ) (about (2500, kcal)) one day and do nothing but sit relaxed for (16.0, h) and sleep for the other (8.00, h)? 
## Part 1 
Sleeping uses (83 ,W) and sitting requires (120, W).
