# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the daily energy needs of a person who sleeps for (7.00, h), walks for (2.00, h), attends classes for (4.00, h), cycles for (2.00, h), sits relaxed for (3.00, h), and studies for (6.00, h). (Studying consumes energy at the same rate as sitting in class.) 
## Part 1 
Sleep requires (83, W), walking (280, W), sitting in class (210, W), cycling (400, W), and sitting relaxed (120, W).
