# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Very large forces are produced in joints when a person jumps from some height to the ground. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force exerted if a ($m-kg) person jumps from a ($h-m) high ledge and lands stiffly, compressing joint material ($dcm, cm) as a result. (Be certain to include the weight of the person.) 
## Part 2 
In practice the knees bend almost involuntarily to help extend the distance over which you stop. Calculate the force exerted if the stopping distance is ($db, m). 
## Part 3 
Determine the ratio of the force exerted with stiff legs to the weight of the person. 
## Part 4 
Determine the ratio of the force with bent legs to the weight of the person.
