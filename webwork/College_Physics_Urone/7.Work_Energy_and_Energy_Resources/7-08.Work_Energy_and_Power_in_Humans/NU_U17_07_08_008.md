# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Shoveling snow can be extremely taxing because the arms have such a low efficiency in this activity (3%). Suppose a person shoveling a footpath metabolizes food at the rate of ($Pin, W). 
## Part 1 
What is her useful power output? 
## Part 2 
How long will it take her to lift ($m, kg) of snow ($h, m)? (This could be the amount of heavy snow on (20, m) of footpath.) 
## Part 3 
How much waste heat transfer will she dissipate in the process?
