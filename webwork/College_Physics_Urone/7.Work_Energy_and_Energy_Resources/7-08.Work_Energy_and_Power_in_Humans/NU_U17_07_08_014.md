# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Mountain climbers carry bottled oxygen when at very high altitudes. 
## Part 1 
Assuming that a mountain climber uses oxygen at (3.92, L/min) (equivalent to (1370, W)), calculate how many litres of oxygen a climber would need for ($hour, h) of climbing. (These are litres at sea level.) 
## Part 2 
Note that only ($percent)% of the inhaled oxygen is utilized; the rest is exhaled. 
## Part 3 
How much useful work does the climber do if he and his equipment have a mass of ($m, kg) and he gains ($h, m) of altitude? 
## Part 4 
What is his efficiency for the ($hour-h) climb?
