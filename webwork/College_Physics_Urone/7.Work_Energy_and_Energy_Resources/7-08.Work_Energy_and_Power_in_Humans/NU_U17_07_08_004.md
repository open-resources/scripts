# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
(Note that (1 , kcal) is equivalent to (4184, J).) 
## Part 1 
What is the efficiency of an out-of-condition professor who does ($joule times 10^5, J) of useful work while metabolizing ($kcal, kcal) of food energy? 
## Part 2 
How many food calories would a well-conditioned athlete metabolize in doing the same work with an efficiency of ($percent)%?
