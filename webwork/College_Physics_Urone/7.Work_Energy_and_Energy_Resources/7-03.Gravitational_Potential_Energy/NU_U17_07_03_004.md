# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The final speed of a roller coaster that has descended ($h, m) is only slightly greater when it has an initial speed of ($v, m/s) than when it starts from rest. This implies that (Delta PE >> KE_i) for the roller coaster's motion. Confirm this statement by determining the ratio of (Delta PE) to (KE_i).
