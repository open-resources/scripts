# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How much gravitational potential energy (relative to the ground on which it isbuilt) is stored in the Great Pyramid of Cheops, given that its mass is about (7.00 times 10^9, kg) and its centre of mass is ($h, m) above the surrounding ground? 
## Part 1 
Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy equivalent of the daily food intake of a person. ((1.2 times 10^7, J)).
