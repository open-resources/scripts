# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A hydroelectric power facility converts the gravitational potential energy of water behind a dam to electric energy. 
## Part 1 
What is the gravitational potential energy relative to the generators of a lake of volume (50.0, km^3) (mass (5.00 times 10^13, kg)), given that the lake has an average height of ($h, m) above the generators? 
## Part 2 
Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy stored in a 9-megaton fusion bomb ((3.8 times 10^16, J)).
