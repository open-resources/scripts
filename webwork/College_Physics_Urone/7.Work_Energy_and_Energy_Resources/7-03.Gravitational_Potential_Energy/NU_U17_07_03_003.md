# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a ($mbg, g) kookaburra (a large kingfisher bird) picks up a ($mag, g) snake and raises it ($h, m) from the ground to a branch. 
## Part 1 
How much work did the bird do on the snake? 
## Part 2 
How much work did the bird do to raise its own centre of mass to the branch?
