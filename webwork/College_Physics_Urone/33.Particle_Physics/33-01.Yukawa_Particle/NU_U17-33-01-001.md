# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A virtual particle having an approximate mass of (10^14) (GeV/c^2) may be associated with the unification of the strong and electroweak forces. For what length of time could this virtual particle exist (in temporary violation of the conservation of mass-energy as allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle)?
