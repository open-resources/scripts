# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A proton and an antiproton collide head-on, with each having a kinetic energy of ($TeV , (TeV) (such as in the LHC at CERN). How much collision energy is available, taking intoaccount the annihilation of the two masses? (Note that this is not significantly greaterthan the extremely relativistic kinetic energy.)$BR$BRans_rule(40) (TeV)$BR$BR
