# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
When an electron and positron collide at the SLAC facility, they each have ($GeV , (GeV)kinetic energies. What is the total collision energy available, taking into account theannihilation energy? Note that the annihilation energy is insignificant, because theelectrons are highly relativistic.$BR$BRans_rule(40) (GeV)$BR$BR
