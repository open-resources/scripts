# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Because of energy loss due to synchrotron radiation in the LHC at CERN, only ($MeV , (MeV) is added to the energy of each proton during each revolution around the mainring. How many revolutions are needed to produce ($TeV , (TeV) (($TeV1 , (GeV) protons, if they are injected with an initial energy of ($GeV , (GeV)?$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
