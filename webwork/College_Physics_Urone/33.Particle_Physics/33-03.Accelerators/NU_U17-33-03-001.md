# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
At full energy, protons in the ($diameter , (km) diameter Fermilab synchrotron travel at nearlythe speed of light, since their energy is about (1000) times their rest mass energy. 
## Part 2 
How long does it take for a proton to complete one trip around? 
## Part 3 
How many times per second will it pass through the target area?
