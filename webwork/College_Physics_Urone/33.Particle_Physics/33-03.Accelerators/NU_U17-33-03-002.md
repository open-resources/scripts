# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose a (W^-) created in a bubble chamber lives for ($t times 10^-25 , (s). What distance does it move in this time if it is traveling at ($velocity , (c)? Since this distance is too short to make a track, the presence of the (W^-) must be inferred from its decay products. 
## Part 2 
Note that the time is longer than the given (W^-) lifetime, which can be due to the statistical nature of decay or time dilation.
