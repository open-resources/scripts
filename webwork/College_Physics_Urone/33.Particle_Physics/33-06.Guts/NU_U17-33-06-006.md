# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Plans for an accelerator that produces a secondary beam of K-mesons to scatter from nuclei, for the purpose of studying the strong force, call for them to have a kinetic energy of ($KE , (MeV). 
## Part 2 
What would the relativistic quantity be for these particles? 
## Part 3 
How long would their average lifetime be in the laboratory? 
## Part 4 
How far could they travel in this time?
