# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The primary decay mode for the negative pion is (pi^-) &#8594; (mu^-)+(v_mu). 
## Part 2 
What is the energy release in (MeV) in this decay? 
## Part 3 
Using conservation of momentum, how much energy does each of the decay products receive, given the (pi^-) is at rest when it decays? You may assume the muon antineutrino is massless and has momentum (p) = (E/c), just like a photon.
