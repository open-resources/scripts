# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
How much energy would be released if the proton did decay via the conjectured reaction (p) &#8594; (pi^0)+(e^+)? 
## Part 2 
Given that the (pi^0) decays to two (s) and that the will find an electron to annihilate, what total energy is ultimately produced in proton decay?
