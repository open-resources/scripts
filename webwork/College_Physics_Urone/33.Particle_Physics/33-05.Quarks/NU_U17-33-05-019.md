# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
There are particles called D-mesons. One of them is the D<sup>+</sup> meson, which has a single positive charge and a baryon number of zero, also the value of its strangeness, topness, and bottomness. It has a charm of (+1). What is its quark configuration? 
## Part 2 
Charm = (c); anticharm = (C); down = (d); antidown = (D); 
## Part 3 
(D^+) = ans_rule(10)
