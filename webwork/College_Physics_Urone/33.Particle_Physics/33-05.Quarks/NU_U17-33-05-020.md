# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
There are particles called bottom mesons or B-mesons. One of them is the B<sup>-</sup> meson, which has a single negative charge; its baryon number is zero, as are its strangeness, charm, and topness. It has a bottomness of (-1). What is its quark configuration? 
## Part 2 
(B^-) = ans_rule(10)
