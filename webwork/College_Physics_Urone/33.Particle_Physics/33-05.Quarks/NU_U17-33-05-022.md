# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
(a) Show that all combinations of three quarks produce integral charges. Thus baryons must have integral charge. Enter in order of increasing charge (more negative charges first. or ; 
## Part 2 
(b) Show that all combinations of a quark and an antiquark produce only integral charges. Thus mesons must have integral charge.
