# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
One decay mode for the eta-zero meson is (eta^0) &#8594; (pi^0)+(pi^0). 
## Part 2 
Write the decay in terms of the quark constituents, then calculate how much energy is released? 
## Part 3 
What is the ultimate release of energy, given the decay mode for the pi zero is (pi^0) &#8594; (gamma)+(gamma)?
