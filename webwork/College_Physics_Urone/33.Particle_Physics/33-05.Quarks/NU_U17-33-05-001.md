# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Verify from its quark composition that the <mtext>Δ</mtext><sup>+</sup> particle could be an excited state of the proton. Enter (u) for an up quark, and (d) for a down quark. 
## Part 2 
<mtext>Δ</mtext><sup>+</sup> = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 3 
There is a spread of about (100 , (MeV) in the decay energy of the , interpreted as uncertainty due to its short lifetime. What is its approximate lifetime?
