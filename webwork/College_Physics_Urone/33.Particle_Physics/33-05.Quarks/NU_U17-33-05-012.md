# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Is the decay (Sigma^-) &#8594; (n) + (pi^-) possible considering the appropriate conservation laws? Enter (0) for "yes" and (1) for "no". 
## Part 2 
Write the decay in terms of the quark constituents of the particles. Let (u) represent the up quark, and (w) represent it's antiparticle. Let (d) represent the down quark, and (D) it's antiparticle. Let (s) represent the strange quark, and (S) it's antiparticle.
