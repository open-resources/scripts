# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A high-pressure gas cylinder contains ($volume) (L) of toxic gas at a pressure of ($pressure times 10^7) (N/m^2) and a temperature of ($temp^circC). Its valve leaks after the cylinder is dropped. The cylinder is cooled to dry ice temperature, (-78.5^circC), to reduce the leak rate and pressure so that it can be safely repaired. 
## Part 1 
What is the final pressure in the tank, assuming a negligible amount of gas leaks while being cooled and that there is no phase change? 
## Part 2 
What is the final pressure if one-tenth of the gas escapes? 
## Part 3 
To what temperature must the tank be cooled to reduce the pressure to (1.00) atm (assuming the gas does not change phase and that there is no leakage during cooling)?
