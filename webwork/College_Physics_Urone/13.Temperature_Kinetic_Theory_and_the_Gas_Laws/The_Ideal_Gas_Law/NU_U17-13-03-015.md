# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the depth to which Avogadro's number of table tennis balls would cover Earth. Each ball has a diameter of (3.75) (cm). Assume the space between balls adds an extra (25.0)(%) to their volume and assume they are not crushed by their own weight. Take the radius of the Earth to be (6.376 times 10^6) (m).
