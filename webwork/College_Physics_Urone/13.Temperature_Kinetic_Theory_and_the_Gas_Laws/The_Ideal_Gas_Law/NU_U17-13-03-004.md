# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Large helium-filled balloons are used to lift scientific equipment to high altitudes. 
## Part 1 
What is the pressure inside such a balloon if it starts out at sea level with a temperature of ($temp^circC) and rises to an altitude where its volume is twenty times the original volume and its temperature is (-$temp2^circC)? 
## Part 2 
What is the gauge pressure?
