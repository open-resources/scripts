# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In the deep space between galaxies, the density of atoms is as low as (10^6) (atoms/m^3) and the temperature is a frigid ($temp) (K). What is the pressure? 
## Part 1 
What volume is occupied by (1) (mol) of gas? 
## Part 2 
If this volume is a cube, what is the length of its sides?
