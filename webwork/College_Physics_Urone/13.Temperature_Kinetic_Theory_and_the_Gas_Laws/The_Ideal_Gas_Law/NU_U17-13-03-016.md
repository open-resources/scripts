# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the gauge pressure in a ($temp^circC) car tire containing ($mol) (mol) of gas in a ($volume) (L) volume? 
## Part 1 
What will its gauge pressure be if you add ($volume2) (L) of gas originally at atmospheric pressure and ($temp^circL)? Assume the temperature returns to ($temp^circC) and the volume remains constant.
