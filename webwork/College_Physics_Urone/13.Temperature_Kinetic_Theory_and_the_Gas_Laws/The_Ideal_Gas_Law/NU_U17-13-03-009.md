# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Use (6.02 times 10^23) as Avogadro's number. 
## Part 1 
What is the volume of Avogadro's number of sand grains if each grain is a cube and has sides that are ($Lc) (mm) long? 
## Part 2 
How many kilometers of beaches in length would this cover if the beach averages ($Lb) (m) in width and ($Db) (m) in depth? Neglect air spaces between grains.
