# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A bicycle tire has a pressure of ($pressure times 10^5) (N/m^2) at a temperature of  ($temp^circC) and contains ($volume) (L) of gas. What will its pressure be if you let out an amount of air that has a volume of (100) (cm^3) at atmospheric pressure? Assume tire temperature and volume remain constant.
