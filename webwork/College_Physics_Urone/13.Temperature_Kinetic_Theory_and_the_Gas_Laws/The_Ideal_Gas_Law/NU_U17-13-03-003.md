# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a gas-filled incandescent light bulb is manufactured so that the gas inside the bulb is at atmospheric pressure when the bulb has a temperature of ($temp^circC). 
## Part 1 
Find the gauge pressure inside such a bulb when it is hot, assuming its average temperature is ($temp2^circC) (an approximation) and neglecting any change in volume due to thermal expansion or gas leaks. 
## Part 2 
The actual final pressure for the light bulb will be less than calculated in part (a) because the glass bulb will expand. What will the actual final pressure be, taking this into account?
