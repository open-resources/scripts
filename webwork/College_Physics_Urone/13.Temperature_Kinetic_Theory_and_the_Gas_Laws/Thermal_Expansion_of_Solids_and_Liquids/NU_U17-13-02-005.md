# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
You are looking to purchase a small piece of land in Hong Kong. The price is “only” $(60,000) per square meter! The land title says the dimensions are ($l times $w) (m). By how much would the total price change if you measured the parcel with a steel tape measure on a day when the temperature was ($temp^circC) above normal? The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is (1.2 times 10^-5)(C^-1).
