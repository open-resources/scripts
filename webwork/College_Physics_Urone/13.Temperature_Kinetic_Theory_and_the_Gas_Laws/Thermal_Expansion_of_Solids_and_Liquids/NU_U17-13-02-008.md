# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a meter stick made of steel and one made of invar (an alloy of iron and nickel) are the same length at (0^circC). What is their difference in length at ($temp^circC)? The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is (1.2 times 10^-5)(^circC^-1) and for invar is (9.0 times 10^-7)(^circC^-1).
