# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If a ($volume)-(mL) glass beaker is filled to the brim with ethyl alcohol at a temperature of ($temp1^circC) how much will overflow when its temperature reaches ($temp2^circC)? The coefficient of volume expansion for ethyl alcohol is ($betaethanol times 10^-3)(^circC^-1). Assume the beaker is initially in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at ($temp2^circC) and does not undergo any temperature change as the ethyl alcohol is transferred. 
## Part 1 
How much less water would overflow under the same conditions? The coefficient of volume expansion for ethyl alcohol is ($betawater times 10^-4)(^circC^-1).
