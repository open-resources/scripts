# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The height of the Washington Monument is measured to be (170) (m) on a day when the temperature is ($temp1^circC). What will its height be on a day when the temperature falls to ($temp2^circC)? Although the monument is made of limestone, assume that its thermal coefficient of expansion is the same as marble's. The thermal coefficient of expansion of marble is (7 times 10^-6) (^circC^-1).
