# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How large an expansion gap should be left between steel railroad rails if they may reach a maximum temperature ($temp^circC) greater than when they were laid? Their original length is ($length) (m). The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is equal to (1.2 times 10^-5) (^circC^-1).
