# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The density of water at (0 ^circC) is very nearly ($densitywater) (kg/m^3), whereas the density of ice at (0 ^circC) is ($densityice) (kg/m^3). Calculate the pressure necessary to keep ice from expanding when it freezes, neglecting the effect such a large pressure would have on the freezing temperature. (This problem gives you only an indication of how large the forces associated with freezing water might be).
