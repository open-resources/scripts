# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Most automobiles have a coolant reservoir to catch radiator fluid that may overflow when the engine is hot. A radiator is made of copper and is filled to its ($Vi)-(L) capacity when at ($temp1^circC). What volume of radiator fluid will overflow when the radiator and fluid reach their ($temp2^circC) operating temperature, given that the fluid's volume coefficient of expansion is ($beta1fluid times 10^-6)(^circC^-1)?
