# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If the relative humidity is ($percent)(%) on a muggy summer morning when the temperature is ($temp1^circC), what will it be later in the day when the temperature is ($temp2^circC), assuming the water vapor density remains constant? The saturated vapor density at (20^circC) is equal to (17.2) (g/m^3) and the saturated vapor density at (30^circC) is equal to (30.4) (g/m^3).
