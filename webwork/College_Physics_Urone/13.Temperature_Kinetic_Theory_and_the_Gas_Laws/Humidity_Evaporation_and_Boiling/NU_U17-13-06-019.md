# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> To get an idea of the small effect that temperature has on Archimedes' principle, calculate the fraction of a copper block's weight that is supported by the buoyant force in (0^circC) water and compare this fraction with the fraction supported in ($temp^circC). The coefficient of volume expansion for copper is equal to (5.1 times 10^-5)(^circC^-1) and the coefficient of volume expansion for water is equal to (2.10 times 10^-4)(^circC^-1). The density of copper is (8800) (kg/m^3). The weight of the copper block can be treated as (1.00) (N) for simplicity. 
## Part 1 
Buoyant Force at (0^circC) = ans_rule(20) 
## Part 2 
Buoyant Force at ($temp^circC) = ans_rule(20) 
## Part 3 
Fraction Value = ans_rule(20)
