# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A deep-sea diver should breathe a gas mixture that has the same oxygen partial pressure as at sea level, where dry air contains ($percent)(%) oxygen and has a total pressure of (1.013 times 10^5) (N/m^2). 
## Part 1 
What is the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level? 
## Part 2 
If the diver breathes a gas mixture at a pressure of ($pressure times 10^6) (N/m^2), what percent oxygen should it be to have the same oxygen partial pressure as at sea level?
