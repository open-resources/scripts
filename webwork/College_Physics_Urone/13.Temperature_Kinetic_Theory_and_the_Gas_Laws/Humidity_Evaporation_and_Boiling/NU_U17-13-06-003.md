# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Pressure cookers increase cooking speed by raising the boiling temperature of water above its value at atmospheric pressure. 
## Part 1 
What pressure is necessary to raise the boiling point to ($temp^circC)? 
## Part 2 
What gauge pressure does this correspond to?
