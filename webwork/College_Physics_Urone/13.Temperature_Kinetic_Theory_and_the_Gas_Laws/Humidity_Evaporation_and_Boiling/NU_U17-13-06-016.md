# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
On a certain day, the temperature is (25^circC) and the relative humidity is ($percent)(%). How many grams of water must condense out of each cubic meter of air if the temperature falls to (15^circC)? Such a drop in temperature can, thus, produce heavy dew or fog.
