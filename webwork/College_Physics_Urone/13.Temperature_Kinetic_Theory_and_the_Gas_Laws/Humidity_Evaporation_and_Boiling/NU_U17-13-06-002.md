# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The vapour pressure of water at ($temp ^circC) is equal to (2330) (Pa). What percent of atmospheric pressure does this constitute? Atmospheric pressure is equal to (101,325) (Pa). 
## Part 1 
What percent of ($temp ^circC) air is water vapor if it has (100)(%) relative humidity? The density of dry air at ($temp ^circC) is (1.20) (kg/m^3) and the saturation vapor density of water at ($temp ^circC) is equal to (0.0172) (kg/m^3).
