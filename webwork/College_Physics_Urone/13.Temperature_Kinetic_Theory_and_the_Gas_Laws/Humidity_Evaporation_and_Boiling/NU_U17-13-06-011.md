# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Air in human lungs has a temperature of ($temp^circC) and a saturation vapor density of (44.0) (g/m^3). 
## Part 1 
If ($volume) (L) of air is exhaled and very dry air inhaled, what is the maximum loss of water vapor by the person? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the partial pressure of water vapor having a density equal to the saturation vapour density at this temperature.
