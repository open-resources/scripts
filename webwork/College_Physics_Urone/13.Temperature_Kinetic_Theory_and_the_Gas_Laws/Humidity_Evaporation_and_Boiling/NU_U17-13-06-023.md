# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
$BR$BR<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>$BR$BR<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> The temperature inside a supernova explosion is said to be ($temp times 10^13) (K). What would the average velocity of hydrogen atoms be? The molar mass of a supernova is equal to ($Mg times 10^-3) (kg/mol).
