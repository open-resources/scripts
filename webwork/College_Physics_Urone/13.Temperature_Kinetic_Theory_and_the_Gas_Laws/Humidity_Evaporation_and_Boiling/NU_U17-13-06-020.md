$BR$BR<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> If you want to cook in water at (150 ^circC), you need a pressure cooker that can withstand the necessary pressure.$BR$BRa) What pressure is required for the boiling point of water to be this high? $BR$BRans_rule(40) (Pa)$BR$BRBEGIN_HINTYou will need to research tabulated values of the boiling point of water as a function of atmospheric pressure.END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$pressure"));$BR$BRb) If the lid of the pressure cooker is a disk ($diameter) (cm) in diameter, what force must it be able to withstand at this pressure?
