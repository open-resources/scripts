# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Atmospheric pressure atop Mt. Everest is (3.30 times 10^4) (N/m^2). 
## Part 1 
What is the partial pressure of oxygen there if it is ($percent) (%) of the air? 
## Part 2 
What percent oxygen should a mountain climber breathe so that its partial pressure is the same as at sea level, where atmospheric pressure is (1.01 times 10^5) (N/m^2)?
