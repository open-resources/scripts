# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
There are two important isotopes of uranium â€”  <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U; these isotopes are nearly identical chemically but have different atomic masses. Only <sup>235</sup>U is very useful in nuclear reactors. One of the techniques for separating them (gas diffusion) is based on the different average velocities (v<sub>rms</sub>) of uranium hexafluoride gas, UF<sub>6</sub>. 
## Part 1 
The molecular masses for  <sup>235</sup>U UF<sub>6</sub>  and <sup>238</sup>U UF<sub>6</sub> are ($M235) (kg/mol) and ($M238) (kg/mol), respectively. What is the ratio of their average velocities? 
## Part 2 
At what temperature would their average velocities differ by ($speed) (m/s)?
