# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The escape velocity of any object from Earth is (11.2) (km/s). 
## Part 1 
Express this speed in (m/s). 
## Part 2 
At what temperature would oxygen molecules having a molecular mass equal to ($M times 10^-2) (kg/mol) have an average velocity equal to Earth's escape velocity of (11.2) (km/s)?
