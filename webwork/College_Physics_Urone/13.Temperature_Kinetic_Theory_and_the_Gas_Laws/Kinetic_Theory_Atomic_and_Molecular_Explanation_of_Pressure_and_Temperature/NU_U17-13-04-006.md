# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Nuclear fusion, the energy source of the Sun, hydrogen bombs, and fusion reactors, occurs much more readily when the average kinetic energy of the atoms is highâ€”that is, at high temperatures. Suppose you want the atoms in your fusion experiment to have average kinetic energies of ($energy times 10^-14) (J) . What temperature is needed?
