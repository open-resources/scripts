# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A pair of (7.5 times ) binoculars produce an angular magnification of ($angular_magnification), acting like a telescope. (Mirrors are used to make the image upright.) If the binoculars have objective lenses with a ($objective_focal_length) (cm) focal length, what is the focal length of the eyepiece lenses?
