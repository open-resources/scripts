## Part 0 
Find the distance between the objective and eyepiece lenses, <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>D</span>, in the telescope above needed to produce a final image very far from the observer, where vision is most relaxed. The objective end eyepiece lenses have focal lengths of ($objective_focal_length) (cm) and  ($eyepiece_focal_length) (cm), respectively.
