# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A small telescope has a concave mirror with a ($radius_of_curvatureSI) (m) radius of curvature for its objective. Its eyepiece is a ($eyepiece_focal_length) (cm) focal length lens. 
## Part 1 
What is the telescope's angular magnification? 
## Part 2 
What angle is subtended by a ($sunspot_diameter) (km) diameter sunspot? Take the distance to the Sun to be (1.496 times 10^8) (km). 
## Part 3 
What is the angle of its telescopic image?
