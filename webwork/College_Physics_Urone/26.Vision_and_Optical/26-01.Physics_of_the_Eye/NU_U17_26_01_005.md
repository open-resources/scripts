# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
People who do very detailed work close up, such as jewelers, often can see objects clearly at much closer distance than the normal ($object_distance_std) (cm). 
## Part 1 
What is the power of the eyes of a woman who can see an object clearly at a distance of only ($object_distance) (cm), assuming a lens-to-retina distance of ($image_distance) (cm)? 
## Part 2 
What is the size of an image of a ($object_height) (mm) object, such as lettering inside a ring, held at this distance? 
## Part 3 
What would the size of the image be if the object were held at the normal ($object_distance_std) (cm) distance?
