# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a certain person's visual acuity is such that he can see objects clearly that forman image ($image_height) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;m</span> high on his retina. What is the maximum distance at which he can read the ($object_height) (cm) high letters on the side of an airplane, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of ($image_distance) (cm)?
