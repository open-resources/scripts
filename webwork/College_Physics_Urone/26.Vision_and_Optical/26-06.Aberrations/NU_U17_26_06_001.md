# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Integrated Concepts $BRa) During laser vision correction, a brief burst of (193) nm ultraviolet light is projected onto the cornea of the patient. It makes a spot ($dmm) mm in diameter and deposits ($QmJ) mJ of energy. Calculate the depth of the layer ablated, assuming the corneal tissue has the same properties as water and is initially at ($T1C ^circC). The tissue's temperature is increased to ($T2C ^circC) and evaporated without further temperature increase.$BR$BRans_rule(40) Âµm$BR$BR
