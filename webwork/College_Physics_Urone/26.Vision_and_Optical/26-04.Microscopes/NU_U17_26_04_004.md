# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
You switch from a ($NA_oil)(NA) (60 times) oil immersion objective to a ($NA_air)(NA) (20 times ) air immersion objective. What is the acceptance angle of each? Oil has an index of refraction of ($n_oil). 
## Part 1 
Oil: ans_rule(40) &#176; 
## Part 2 
Air: ans_rule(40) &#176;
