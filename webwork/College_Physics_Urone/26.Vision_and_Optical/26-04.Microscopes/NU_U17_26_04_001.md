# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A microscope with an overall magnification of ($overall_magnification_a) has an objective that magnifies by ($objective_magnification_a). 
## Part 1 
What is the magnification of the eyepiece? 
## Part 2 
If there are two other objectives that can be used, having magnifications of ($objective_magnification_low) and ($objective_magnification_high), what other total magnifications are possible? 
## Part 3 
Low:  ans_rule(40) 
## Part 4 
High: ans_rule(40)
