# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What magnification is produced by a ($focal_length) (cm) focal length microscope objective that is ($object_distance) (cm) from the object being viewed? 
## Part 1 
What is the overall magnification if an eyepiece having a magnification of ($eyepiece_magnification) is used?
