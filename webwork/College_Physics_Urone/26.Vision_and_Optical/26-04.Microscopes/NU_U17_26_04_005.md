## Part 0 
An amoeba is ($objective_object_distance) (cm) away from the ($objective_focal_length) (cm) focal length objective lens of a microscope. 
## Part 1 
Where is the image formed by the objective lens? 
## Part 2 
What is this image's magnification? 
## Part 3 
An eyepiece with a ($eyepiece_focal_length) (cm) focal length is placed ($lens_spacing) (cm) from the objective. Where is the final image? 
## Part 4 
What magnification is produced by the eyepiece? 
## Part 5 
What is the overall magnification?
