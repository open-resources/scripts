## Part 0 
Where does an object need to be placed relative to a microscope for its ($objective_focal_length) (cm) focal length objective to produce a magnification of ($objective_magnification)? 
## Part 1 
How far behind the objective lens should the ($eyepiece_focal_length) (cm) focal length eyepiece be placed to produce a further ($eyepiece_magnification times) magnification?
