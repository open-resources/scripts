# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The contact lens prescription for a nearsighted person is ($focal_power_lens) (D) and the person has a far point of ($far_point) (cm). What is the power of the tear layer between the cornea and the lens if the correction is ideal, taking the tear layer into account?
