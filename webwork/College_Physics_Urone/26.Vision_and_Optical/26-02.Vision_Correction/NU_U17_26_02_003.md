# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A laser vision correction reshaping the cornea of a myopic patient reduces thepower of his eye by ($focal_power_change) (D), with a <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&#177;</span>($ratio)(%) uncertainty in the final correction. What is the range of diopters for spectacle lenses that this person might need after LASIKprocedure?
