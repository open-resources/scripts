# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Some satellites use nuclear power. 
## Part 1 
If such a satellite emits a ($powerSI,-W) flux of (gamma) rays having an average energy of ($energy , MeV), how many are emitted per second? 
## Part 2 
These (gamma) rays affect other satellites. How far away must another satellite be to only receive one (gamma) ray per second per square meter?
