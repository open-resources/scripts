# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If the power output of a ($frequency , kHz) radio station is ($power , kW), how many photons per second are produced? 
## Part 1 
BEGIN_HINTPerhaps using dimensional analysis, can you first express the power output in terms of: 
## Part 2 
<b>i.</b> the frequency of the photons emitted, and 
## Part 3 
<b>ii.</b> the number of photons emitted each second, 
## Part 4 
recalling the formula for the energy of a photon?END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$n")); 
## Part 5 
If the radio waves are broadcast uniformly in all directions, find the number of photons per second per square meter at a distance of ($radius , km). Assume no reflection from the ground or absorption by the air.
