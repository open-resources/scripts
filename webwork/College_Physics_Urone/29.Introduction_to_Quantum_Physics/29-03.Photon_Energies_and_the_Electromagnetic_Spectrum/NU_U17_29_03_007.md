# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the energy of an IR photon of frequency ($frequency_a times 10^13  , Hz). 
## Part 1 
How many of these photons would need to be absorbed simultaneously to ionize a molecule tightly bound by ($energy_ionize , eV)? 
## Part 2 
What is the energy of a (gamma)-ray of frequency ($frequency_b times 10^20 , Hz). 
## Part 3 
How many tightly bound molecules could a single such (gamma) ray break apart?
