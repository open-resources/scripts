# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Assuming that ($percent %) of a ($powerSI , -W) light bulb's energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an average wavelength of ($wavelength , nm), and that the photons spread out uniformly and are not absorbed by the atmosphere, how far away would you be if ($n_eye) photons per second enter the ($diameter_eye , -mm) diameter pupil of your eye? (This number easily stimulates the retina.)
