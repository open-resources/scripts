# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the ratio of power outputs, (fracAB), for microwave ovens (A), having a frequency of ($frequency_low , MHz), and (B), having a frequency of ($frequency_high , MHz), if they emit the same number of photons per second? 
## Part 1 
BEGIN_HINTPerhaps using dimensional analysis, can you first express each power output in terms of: 
## Part 2 
<b>i.</b> the frequency of the photons emitted, and 
## Part 3 
<b>ii.</b> the number of photons emitted each second, 
## Part 4 
recalling the formula for the energy of a photon?END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$power_ratio")); 
## Part 5 
What is the ratio (fracAB) of photons per second if they have the same power output?
