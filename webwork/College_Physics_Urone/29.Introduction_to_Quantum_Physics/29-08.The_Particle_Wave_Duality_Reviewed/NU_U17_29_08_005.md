# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the amount of microwave energy in joules needed to raise the temperature of ($mass_soupSI , kg) of soup from ($temp_lowSI , ^circC) to ($temp_highSI , ^circC). Assume the soup has the same specific heat as water. 
## Part 1 
What is the total momentum of all the microwave photons it takes to do this? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the velocity of a ($mass_XSI , kg) mass with the same momentum. 
## Part 3 
What is the kinetic energy of this mass?
