# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($wavelength , fm) photon has a wavelength short enough to detect some information about nuclei. 
## Part 1 
What is the photon momentum? 
## Part 2 
What is its energy? 
## Part 3 
What is the (relativistic) velocity of an electron with the same momentum? Take the mass of an electron to be (9.11 times 10^-31 , kg). 
## Part 4 
Calculate the electron's kinetic energy.
