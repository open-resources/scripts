<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> One problem with x-rays is that they are not sensed. Calculate the temperature increase of a researcher exposed in a few seconds to a nearly fatal accidental dose of x-rays under the following conditions. The energy of the x-ray photons is ($energy_per_photon , keV) and ($photons_per_mass times 10^13) of them are absorbed per kilogram of tissue, the specific heat of which is ($heat_capacity , frackcalkg cdot ^circC). (Note that medical diagnostic x-ray machines cannot produce an intensity this great.)
