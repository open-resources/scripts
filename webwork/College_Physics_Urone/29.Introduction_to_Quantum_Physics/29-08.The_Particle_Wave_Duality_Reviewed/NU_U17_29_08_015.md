# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere has an intensity of ($intensity , kW/m^2). If this is reflected straight back from a mirror that has only a small recoil. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force per square meter of mirror. 
## Part 2 
Very low mass mirrors can be constructed in the near weightlessness of space, and attached to a spaceship to sail it. Once done, the average mass per square meter of the spaceship is ($mass_per_areaSI , kg). Find the acceleration of the spaceship if all other forces are balanced. 
## Part 3 
How fast is it moving ($time) hours later?
