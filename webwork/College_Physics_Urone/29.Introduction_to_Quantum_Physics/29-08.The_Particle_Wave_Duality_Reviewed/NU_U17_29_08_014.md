# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> The momentum of light is exactly reversed when reflected straight back from a mirror, assuming negligible recoil of the mirror. Suppose light of intensity ($intensity , kW/m^2) reflects from a mirror of area ($areaSI , m^2). 
## Part 1 
What is the momentum imparted to the mirror? 
## Part 2 
Using the most general form of Newton's second law, what is the force on the mirror?
