# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A certain heat lamp emits ($powerSI , W) of mostly IR radiation averaging ($wavelength , nm) in wavelength. 
## Part 1 
What is the average photon energy in joules? 
## Part 2 
How many of these photons are required to increase the temperature of a person's shoulder by ($delta_tempSI , ^circC) assuming the affected mass is ($massSI , kg) with a specific heat of ($heat_capacity , frackcalkg cdot C). Assume no other significant heat transfer. 
## Part 3 
How long does this take?
