# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> On its high power setting, a microwave oven produces ($powerSI , W) of ($frequency , MHz) microwaves. 
## Part 1 
How many photons per second is this? 
## Part 2 
BEGIN_HINTPerhaps using dimensional analysis, can you first express the power output in terms of: 
## Part 3 
<b>i.</b> the frequency of the photons emitted, and 
## Part 4 
<b>ii.</b> the number of photons emitted each second, 
## Part 5 
recalling the formula for the energy of a photon?END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$photons_per_secondSI")); 
## Part 6 
How many photons are required to increase the temperature of a ($massSI , kg) mass of pasta by ($delta_tempSI ^circC) , assuming a specific heat of ($heat_capacity (frackcalkg cdot C)? Neglect all other heat transfer. 
## Part 7 
How long must the microwave operator wait for their pasta to be ready?
