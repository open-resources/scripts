# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A physicist is watching a (15.0)-(kg) orangutan at a zoo swing lazily in a tire at the end of a rope. He (the physicist) notices that each oscillation takes ($periodSI) (s) and hypothesizes that the energy is quantized. 
## Part 1 
What is the difference in energy in joules between allowed oscillator states? 
## Part 2 
What is the value of (n) for a state where the energy is ($energy_bSI) (J)?
