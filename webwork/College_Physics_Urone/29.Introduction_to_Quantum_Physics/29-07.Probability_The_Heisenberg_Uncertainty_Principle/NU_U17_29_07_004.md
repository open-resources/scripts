# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The velocity of a proton in an accelerator is known to an accuracy of ($percent %) of the speed of light. (This could be small compared with its velocity.) What is the smallest possible uncertainty in its position? Take the mass of a proton to be (1.673 times 10^-27 , kg).
