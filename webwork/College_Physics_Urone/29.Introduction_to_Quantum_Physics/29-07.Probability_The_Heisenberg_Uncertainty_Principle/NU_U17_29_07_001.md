# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If the position of an electron in a membrane is measured to an accuracy of ($Uposition) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;m</span>, what is the electron's minimum uncertainty in velocity? Take the mass of an electron to be (9.11 times 10^-31 , kg). 
## Part 1 
If the electron has this velocity, what is its kinetic energy?
