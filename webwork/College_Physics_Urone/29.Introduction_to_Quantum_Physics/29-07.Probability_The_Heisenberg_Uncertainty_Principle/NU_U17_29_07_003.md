# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose the velocity of an electron in an atom is known to an accuracy of ($Uvelocity times 10^3 , m/s) (reasonably accurate compared with orbital velocities). What is the electron's minimum uncertainty in position? Take the mass of an electron to be (9.11 times 10^-31 , kg).
