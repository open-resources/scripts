# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Photoelectrons from a material with a binding energy of ($phi , eV) are ejected by ($wavelength , -nm) photons. Once ejected, how long does it take these electrons to travel ($distance , cm) to a detection device? Take the mass of an electron to be (9.11 times 10^-31 , kg).
