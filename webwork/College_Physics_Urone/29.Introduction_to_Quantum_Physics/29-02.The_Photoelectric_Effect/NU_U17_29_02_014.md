# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the number of photoelectrons per second ejected from a ($area , -mm^2) area of sodium metal by ($wavelength , nm) EM radiation having an intensity of ($intensity , kW/m^2) (the intensity of sunlight above the Earth's atmosphere). 
## Part 1 
Given that the binding energy is ($phi , eV), what power is carried away by the electrons?
