# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the wavelength of a photon that has the same momentum as a proton moving at ($percent %) of the speed of light. Take the mass of a proton to be (1.673 times 10^-27 , kg). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the energy of the photon. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the kinetic energy of the proton.
