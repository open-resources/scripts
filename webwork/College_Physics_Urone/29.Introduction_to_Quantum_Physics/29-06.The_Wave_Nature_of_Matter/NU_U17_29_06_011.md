# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The velocity of a proton emerging from a Van de Graaff accelerator is ($percent %) of the speed of light. 
## Part 1 
What is the proton's wavelength? Take the mass of a proton to be (1.673 times 10^-27 , kg). 
## Part 2 
What is its kinetic energy, assuming it is nonrelativistic? 
## Part 3 
What was the equivalent voltage through which it was accelerated?
