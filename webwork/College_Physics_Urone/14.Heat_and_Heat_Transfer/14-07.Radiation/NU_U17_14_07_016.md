# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: Suppose you start a workout on a Stairmaster, producing power at the same rate as climbing (116) stairs per minute. Assuming your mass is ($m) (kg) and your efficiency is ($efficiency)(%), how long will it take for your body temperature to rise ($T ^circC) if all other forms of heat transfer in and out of your body are balanced?
