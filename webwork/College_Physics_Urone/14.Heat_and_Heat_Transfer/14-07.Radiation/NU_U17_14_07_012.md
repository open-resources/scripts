# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: One ($T1C ^circC) day the relative humidity is (75)%, and that evening the temperature drops to ($T2C ^circC), well below the dew point. 
## Part 1 
How many grams of water condense from each cubic meter of air? 
## Part 2 
How much heat transfer occurs by this condensation? 
## Part 3 
What temperature increase could this cause in dry air?
