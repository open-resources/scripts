# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: In certain large geographic regions, the underlying rock is hot. Wells can be drilled and water circulated through the rock for heat transfer for the generation of electricity. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the heat transfer that can be extracted by cooling (1.00) (km^3) of granite by ($T ^circC). 
## Part 2 
How long will this take if heat is transferred at a rate of ($PMW) (MW), assuming no heat transfers back into (1.00) (km^3) the of rock by its surroundings?
