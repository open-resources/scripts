# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: Frozen waste from airplane toilets has sometimes been accidentally ejected at high altitude. Ordinarily it breaks up and disperses over a large area, but sometimes it holds together and strikes the ground. Calculate the mass of (0 ^circC) ice that can be melted by the conversion of kinetic and gravitational potential energy when a ($M) (kg) piece of frozen waste is released at ($hkm) (km) altitude while moving at ($vi) (m/s) and strikes the ground at ($vf) (m/s) (since less than ($M) (kg) melts, a significant mess results).
