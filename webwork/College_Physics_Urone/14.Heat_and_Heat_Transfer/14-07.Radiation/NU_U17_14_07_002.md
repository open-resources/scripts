# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Cherry-red embers in a fireplace are at ($T1C ^circC) and have an exposed area of ($A) (m^2) and an emissivity of ($e). The surrounding room has a temperature of ($T2C  ^circC). If (50)(%) of the radiant energy enters the room, what is the net rate of radiant heat transfer in kilowatts?
