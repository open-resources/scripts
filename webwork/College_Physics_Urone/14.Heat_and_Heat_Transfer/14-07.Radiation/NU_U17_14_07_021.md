# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: Hot air rises because it has expanded. It then displaces a greater volume of cold air, which increases the buoyant force on it. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the ratio of the buoyant force to the weight of ($Th ^circC) air surrounded by ($Tc ^circC) air. 
## Part 2 
What energy is needed to cause ($V) (m^3) of air to go from ($Tc ^circC) to ($Th ^circC) under constant volume conditions? 
## Part 3 
What gravitational potential energy is gained by this volume of air if it rises ($h) (m)?
