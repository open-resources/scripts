# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the temperature the entire sky would have to be in order to transfer energyby radiation at ($QtA W/m^2)â€”about the rate at which the Sun radiates when it is directly overhead on a clear day. This value is the effective temperature of the sky, a kind of average that takes account of the fact that the Sun occupies only a small partof the sky but is much hotter than the rest. Assume that the body receiving the energyhas a temperature of ($T2C ^circC).
