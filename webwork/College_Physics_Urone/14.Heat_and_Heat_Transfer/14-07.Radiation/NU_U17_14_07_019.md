# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: Heat transfers from your lungs and breathing passages byevaporating water. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the maximum number of grams of water that can be evaporated when you inhale (1.50) (L) of ($T ^circC) air with an original relative humidity of (40.0)(%). Assume that body temperature is also ($T ^circC). 
## Part 2 
How many joules of energy are required to evaporate this amount? 
## Part 3 
What is the rate of heat transfer in watts from this method, if you breathe at a normal resting rate of ($N) breaths per minute?
