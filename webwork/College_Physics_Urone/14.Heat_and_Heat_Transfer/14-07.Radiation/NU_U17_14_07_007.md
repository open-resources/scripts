## Part 0 
Thermography is a technique for measuring radiant heat and detecting variations in surface temperatures that may be medically, environmentally, or militarily meaningful. 
## Part 1 
What is the percent increase in the rate of heat transfer by radiation from a given area at a temperature of ($TC ^circC) compared with that at ($TaC ^circC), such as on a person's skin? 
## Part 2 
What is the percent increase in the rate of heat transfer by radiation from a given area at a temperature of ($TC ^circC) compared with that at ($TbC ^circC), such as for warm and cool automobile hoods?
