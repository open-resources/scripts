# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Find the net rate of heat transfer by radiation from a skier standing in the shade, given the following: she is completely clothed in white (head to foot, including a ski mask), the clothes have an emissivity of ($e) and a surface temperature of ($T1C ^circC), the surroundings are at ($T2C ^circC), and her surface area is ($A) (m^2).
