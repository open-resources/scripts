# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A large body of lava from a volcano has stopped flowing and is slowly cooling. The interior of the lava is at ($TinC ^circC), its surface is at ($TsaC ^circC), and the surroundings are at ($TsurrC ^circC). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the rate at which energy is transferred by radiation from ($A) (m^2) of surface lava into the surroundings, assuming the emissivity is ($e). 
## Part 2 
Suppose heat conduction to the surface occurs at the same rate. What is the thickness of the lava between the ($TsaC ^circC) surface and the ($TinC ^circC) interior, assuming that the lava's conductivity is the same as that of brick?
