# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A shirtless rider under a circus tent feels the heat radiating from the sunlit portion of the tent. Calculate the temperature of the tent canvas based on the following information: The shirtless rider's skin temperature is ($T1C ^circC) and has an emissivity of ($e). The exposed area of skin is ($A m^2). He receives radiation at the rate of ($Qt) (W)â€”half what you would calculate if the entire region behind him was hot. The rest of the surroundings are at ($T1C ^circC).
