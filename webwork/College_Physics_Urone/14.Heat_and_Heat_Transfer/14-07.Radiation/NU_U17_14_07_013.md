# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Integrated Concepts: Large meteors sometimes strike the Earth, converting most oftheir kinetic energy into thermal energy. 
## Part 1 
What is the kinetic energy of a ($M times 10^9) (kg) meteor moving at ($vkm) (km/s)? 
## Part 2 
If this meteor lands in a deep ocean and (80)(%) of its kinetic energy goes into heating water, how many kilograms of water could it raise by ($T ^circC)?
