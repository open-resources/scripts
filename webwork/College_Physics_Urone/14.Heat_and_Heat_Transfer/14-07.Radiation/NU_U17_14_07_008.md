# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The Sun radiates like a perfect black body with an emissivity of exactly ($e). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the surface temperature of the Sun, given that it is a sphere with a ($rsun times 10^8) (m) radius that radiates ($Psun times 10^26) (W) into empty space having a temperature of (3.0) (K). 
## Part 2 
How much power does the Sun radiate per square meter of its surface? 
## Part 3 
How much power in watts per square meter is that value at the distance of Earth, ($dtoearth times 10^11) m away? (This number is called the solar constant).
