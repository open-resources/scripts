# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A firewalker runs across a bed of hot coals without sustaining burns. Calculate the heat transferred by conduction into the sole of one foot of a firewalker given that the bottom of the foot is a ($dmm)-(mm)-thick callus with a conductivity at the low end of the range for wood and its density is ($p ) (kg/m^3). The area of contact is ($Acm) (cm^2), the temperature of the coals is ($T2^circC), and the time in contact is ($t) (s). 
## Part 1 
What temperature increase is produced in the ($Vcm) (cm^3) of tissue affected?
