# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Some stove tops are smooth ceramic for easy cleaning. If the ceramic is ($dcm) (cm) thick and heat conduction occurs through an area of ($Acm times10^-2) (m^2) and at a rate of ($QtkW) (kW), what is the temperature difference across it? Ceramic has the same thermal conductivity as glass and brick.
