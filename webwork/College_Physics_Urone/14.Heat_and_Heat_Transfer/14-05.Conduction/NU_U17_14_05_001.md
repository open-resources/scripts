# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the rate of heat conduction through house walls that are ($dcm) (cm) thick and that have an average thermal conductivity twice that of glass wool. Assume there are no windows or doors. The surface area of the walls is ($A) (m^2) and their inside surface is at ($T2 ^circC), while their outside surface is at ($T1 ^circC).
