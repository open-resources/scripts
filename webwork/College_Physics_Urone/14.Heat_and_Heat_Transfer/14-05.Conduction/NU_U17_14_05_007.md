# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
What is the rate of heat conduction through the ($dcm)-(cm)-thick fur of a large animal having a ($A) (m^2) surface area? Assume that the animal's skin temperature is ($T2^circC), that the air temperature is ($T1^circC), and that fur has the same thermal conductivity as air. 
## Part 1 
What food intake will the animal need in one day to replace this heat transfer?
