# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
For the human body, what is the rate of heat transfer by conduction through the body's tissue with the following conditions: the tissue thickness is ($dcm) (cm), the change in temperature is ($T^circC), and the skin area is ($A) (m^2). How does this compare with the average heat transfer rate to the body resulting from an energy intake of about (2400) (kcal) per day? (No exercise is included).
