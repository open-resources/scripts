# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
(a) Calculate the rate of heat conduction through a double-paned window that has a ($A) (m^2) area and is made of two panes of ($d1cm)-(cm)-thick glass separated by a ($d2cm)-(cm) air gap. The inside surface temperature is ($T2^circC), while that on the outside is ($T1^circC). Ignore the increased heat transfer in the air gap due to convection. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the rate of heat conduction through a ($d3cm)-(cm)-thick window of the same area and with the same temperatures.
