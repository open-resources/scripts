# {{ params.vars.title }}![Walrus.](NU_U17_14_05_008.png)

## Part 0 
A walrus transfers energy by conduction through its blubber at the rate of ($Qt) (W) when immersed in ($T1^circC) water. The walrus's internal core temperature is ($T2^circC), and it has a surface area of ($A) (m^2). What is the average thickness of its blubber, which has the conductivity of fatty tissues without blood?
