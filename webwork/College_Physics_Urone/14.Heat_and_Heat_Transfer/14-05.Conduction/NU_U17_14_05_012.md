# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
One easy way to reduce heating (and cooling) costs is to add extra insulation in the attic of a house. Suppose the house already had ($dcm) (cm) of fiberglass insulation in the attic and in all the exterior surfaces. If you added an extra (8.0) (cm) of fiberglass to the attic, then by what percentage would the heating cost of the house drop? Take the single story house to be of dimensions ($l) (m) by ($w) (m) by ($h) (m). Ignore air infiltration and heat loss through windows and doors. Assume that the floor is also insulated.
