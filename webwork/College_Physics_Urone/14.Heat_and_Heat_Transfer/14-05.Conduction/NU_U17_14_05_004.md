# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you stand with one foot on ceramic flooring and one foot on a wool carpet, making contact over an area of ($Acm) (cm^2) with each foot. Both the ceramic and the carpet are ($dcm) (cm) thick and are ($T1^circC) on their bottom sides. Take the thermal conductivity of ceramic to be that same as that of concrete. 
## Part 1 
At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the ceramic at ($T2^circC)? 
## Part 2 
At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the carpet at ($T2^circC)?
