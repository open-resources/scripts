# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a person is covered head to foot by wool clothing with average thickness of($dcm) (cm) and is transferring energy by conduction through the clothing at the rate of($Qt) (W). What is the temperature difference across the clothing, given the surfacearea is ($A) (m^2)?
