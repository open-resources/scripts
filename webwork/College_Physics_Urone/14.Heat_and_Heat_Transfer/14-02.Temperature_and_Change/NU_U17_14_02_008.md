# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The number of kilocalories in food is determined by calorimetry techniques in which the food is burned and the amount of heat transfer is measured. How many kilocalories per gram are there in a ($mp) (g) peanut if the energy from burning it is transferred to ($mw) (kg) of water held in a ($mal) (kg) aluminum cup, causing a ($T ^circC) temperature increase?
