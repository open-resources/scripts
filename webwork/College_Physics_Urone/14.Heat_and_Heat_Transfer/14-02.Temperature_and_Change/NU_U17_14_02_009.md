# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Following vigorous exercise, the body temperature of an ($m)-(kg) person is ($T2 ^circC). At what rate in watts must the person transfer thermal energy to reduce the body temperature to ($T1 ^circC) in ($tmin) (min), assuming the body continues to produce energy at the rate of ($Pbody) (W)?
