# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($m)-(kg) block of a pure material is heated from ($T1 ^circC) to ($T2 ^circC) by the addition of ($QkJ) (kJ) of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed. 
## Part 1 
The material having this specific heat capacity is ans_rule(20)
