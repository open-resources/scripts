## Part 0 
Even when shut down after a period of normal use, a large commercial nuclear reactor transfers thermal energy at the rate of (150) (MW) by the radioactive decay of fission products. This heat transfer causes a rapid increase in temperature if the cooling system fails. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the rate of temperature increase in degrees Celsius per second ((^circC)(/s)) if the mass of the reactor core is (1.60 times 10^5) (kg) and it has an average specific heat of (0.3349) (kJ/kg ^circC). 
## Part 2 
How long would it take to obtain a temperature increase of ($increase ^circC), which could cause some metals holding the radioactive materials to melt?(The initial rate of temperature increase would be greater than that calculated herebecause the heat transfer is concentrated in a smaller mass. Later, however, thetemperature increase would slow down because the (5.00 times 10^5) (kg) steel containment vessel would also begin to heat up.)
