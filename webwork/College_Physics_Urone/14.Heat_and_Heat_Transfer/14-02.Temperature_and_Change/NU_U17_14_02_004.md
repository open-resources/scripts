# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The same heat transfer into identical masses of different substances produces different temperature changes. Calculate the final temperature when (1.00) (kcal) of heat transfers into (1.00) (kg) of the following, originally at ($T1 ^circC): 
## Part 1 
water 
## Part 2 
concrete 
## Part 3 
steel 
## Part 4 
mercury
