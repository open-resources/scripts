# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
One winter day, the climate control system of a large university classroom building malfunctions. As a result, ($V) (m^3) of excess cold air is brought in each minute. At what rate in kilowatts must heat transfer occur to warm this air by ($T^circC) (that is, to bring the air to room temperature)?
