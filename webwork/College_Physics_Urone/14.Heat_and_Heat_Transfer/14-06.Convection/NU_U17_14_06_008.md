# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
During heavy exercise, the body pumps ($VL) (L) of blood per minute to the surface,where it is cooled by ($T ^circC). What is the rate of heat transfer from this forcedconvection alone, assuming blood has the same specific heat as water and its densityis ($p) (kg/m^3)?
