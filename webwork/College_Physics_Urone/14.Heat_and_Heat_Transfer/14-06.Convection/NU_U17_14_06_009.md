# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A person inhales and exhales ($VL) (L) of ($T2 ^circC) air, evaporating ($mg times 10^-2) (g) of water from the lungs and breathing passages with each breath. 
## Part 1 
How much heat transfer occurs due to evaporation in each breath? 
## Part 2 
What is the rate of heat transfer in watts if the person is breathing at a moderate rate of ($N) breaths per minute? 
## Part 3 
If the inhaled air had a temperature of ($T1 ^circC), what is the rate of heat transfer for warming the air?
