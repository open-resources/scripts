# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A glass coffee pot has a circular bottom with a ($dcm)-(cm) diameter in contact with a heating element that keeps the coffee warm with a continuous heat transfer rate of ($P) (W). 
## Part 1 
What is the temperature of the bottom of the pot, if it is ($dmm) (W) thick and the inside temperature is ($T1 ^circC)? 
## Part 2 
If the temperature of the coffee remains constant and all of the heat transfer is removed by evaporation, how many grams per minute evaporate? Take the heat of vaporization to be ($Lv) (kJ/kg).
