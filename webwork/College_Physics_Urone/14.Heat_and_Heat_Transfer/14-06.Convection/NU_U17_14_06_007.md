# {{ params.vars.title }}![Kilauea Volcano.](NU_U17_14_06_007.png)

## Part 0 
The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii is the world's most active, disgorging about ($Va times 10^5) (m^3) of ($T2^circC) lava per day. What is the rate of heat transfer out of Earth by convection if this lava has a density of ($p) (kg/m^3) and eventually cools to ($T1 ^circC)? Assume that the specific heat of lava is the same as that of granite.
