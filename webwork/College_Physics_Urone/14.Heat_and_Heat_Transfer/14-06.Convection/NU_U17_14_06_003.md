# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The “steam” above a freshly made cup of instant coffee is really water vapour droplets condensing after evaporating from the hot coffee. What is the final temperature of ($mc) (g) of hot coffee initially at ($Ti^circC) if ($me) (g) evaporates from it? The coffee is in a Styrofoam cup, so other methods of heat transfer can be neglected. Assume the coffee has the same thermal properties of water.
