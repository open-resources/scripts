# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In 1986, a gargantuan iceberg broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. It was approximately a rectangle ($lkm) (km) long, ($wkm) (km) wide, and ($h) (m) thick. (a) What is the mass of this iceberg, given that the density of ice is ($p) (kg/m^3)? 
## Part 1 
(b) How much heat transfer (in joules) is needed to melt it? 
## Part 2 
How many years would it take sunlight alone to melt ice this thick, if the ice absorbs an average of (100 W/m^2), ($hour)  (h) per day?
