# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A bag containing (0 ^circC) ice is much more effective in absorbing energy than onecontaining the same amount of (0 ^circC) water. 
## Part 1 
How much heat transfer is necessary to raise the temperature of ($m) (kg) of water from (0 ^circC) to ($T ^circC)? 
## Part 2 
How much heat transfer is required to first melt ($m) (kg) of (0 ^circC) ice and then raise its temperature?
