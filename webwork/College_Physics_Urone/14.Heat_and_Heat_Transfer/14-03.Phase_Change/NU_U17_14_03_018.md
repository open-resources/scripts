# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In some countries, liquid nitrogen is used on dairy trucks instead of mechanical refrigerators. A (3.00)-hour delivery trip requires (200) (L) of liquid nitrogen, which has a density of ($p kg/m^3). 
## Part 1 
Calculate the heat transfer necessary to evaporate this amount of liquid nitrogen and raise its temperature to (3.00 ^circC). (Use and assume it is constant over the temperature range.) This value is the amount of cooling the liquid nitrogen supplies. Assume conditions of constant pressure. 
## Part 2 
What is this heat transfer rate in kilowatt-hours? 
## Part 3 
Compare the amount of cooling obtained from melting an identical mass of (0^circC) ice with that from evaporating the liquid nitrogen.
