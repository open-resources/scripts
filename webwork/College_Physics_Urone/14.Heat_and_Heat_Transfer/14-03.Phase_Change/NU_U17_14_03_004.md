# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The formation of condensation on a glass of ice water causes the ice to melt faster than it would otherwise. If ($mw) (g) of condensation forms on a glass containing both water and (200) (g) of ice, how many grams of the ice will melt as a result? Assume no other heat transfer occurs.
