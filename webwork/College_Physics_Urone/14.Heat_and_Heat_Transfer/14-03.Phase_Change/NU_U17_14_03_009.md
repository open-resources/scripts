# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How many grams of coffee must evaporate from ($mc) (g) of coffee in a ($mg)-(g) glass cup to cool the coffee from ($T2 ^circC) to ($T1 ^circC)? You may assume the coffee has the same thermal properties as water and that the average heat of vaporization is ($Lv) (kJ/kg). (You may neglect the change in mass of the coffee as it cools, which will give you an answer that is slightly larger than correct.)
