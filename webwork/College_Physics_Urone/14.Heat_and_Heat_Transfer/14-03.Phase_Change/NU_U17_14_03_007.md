# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How much heat transfer is necessary to raise the temperature of a ($m)-(kg) piece of ice from (-20.0 ^circC) to (130.0 ^circC), including the energy needed for phase changes? 
## Part 1 
How much time is required for the process, assuming a constant ($P) (kJ/s) rate of heat transfer?
