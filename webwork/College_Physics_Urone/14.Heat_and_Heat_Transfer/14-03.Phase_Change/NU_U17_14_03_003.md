# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
How much heat transfer is required to raise the temperature of a ($mal)-(kg) aluminum pot containing ($mw) (kg) of water from ($T1 ^circC) to the boiling point and then boil away ($mal) (kg) of water? 
## Part 1 
How long does this take if the rate of heat transfer is ($P) (W)?
