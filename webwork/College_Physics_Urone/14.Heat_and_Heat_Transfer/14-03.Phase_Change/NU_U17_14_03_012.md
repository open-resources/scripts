# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
To help prevent frost damage, ($ma) (kg) of (0 ^circC) water is sprayed onto a fruit tree. 
## Part 1 
How much heat transfer occurs as the water freezes? 
## Part 2 
How much would the temperature of the ($mb)-(kg) tree decrease if this amount of heat transferred from the tree? Take the specific heat to be (3.35 kJ/kg)(^circC), and assume that no phase change occurs.
