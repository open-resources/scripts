# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Indigenous people sometimes cook in watertight baskets by placing hot rocks into water to bring it to a boil. What mass of ($T1 ^circC) rock must be placed in ($mrock) (kg) of ($T2 ^circC) water to bring its temperature to ($Te ^circC), if ($mv) (kg) of water escapes as vapour from the initial sizzle? You may neglect the effects of the surroundings and take the average specific heat of the rocks to be that of granite.
