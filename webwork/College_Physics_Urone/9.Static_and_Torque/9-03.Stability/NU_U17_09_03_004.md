# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A person carries a plank of wood ($d) (m) long with one hand pushing down on it at one end with a force (F_1) and the other hand holding it up with a force of (F_2) applied at a distance of ($r2) (m) from the same end of the plank. The plank has a mass of ($m1) (kg) and its centre of gravity is at the middle of the plank. 
## Part 1 
What is the force (F_1)? 
## Part 2 
What is the force (F_2)?
