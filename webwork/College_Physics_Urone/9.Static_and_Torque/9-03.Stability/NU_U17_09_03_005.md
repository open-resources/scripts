# {{ params.vars.title }}![Wall and Braces](NU_U17_09_03_005.png)

## Part 0 
A ($h)-(m)-high and ($l)-(m)-long wall under construction and its bracing are shown in the figure above. (Ignore the numbers in the figure; the correct numbers are given in the previous sentence.) The wall is in stable equilibrium without the bracing but can pivot at its base. Calculate the force exerted by each of the ($N) braces if a strong wind exerts a horizontal force of ($FA) (N) on each square meter of the wall. Assume that the net force from the wind acts at a height halfway up the wall, assume that the braces are all attached halfway up the wall, and assume that all braces exert equal forces parallel to their lengths. Neglect the thickness of the wall.
