# {{ params.vars.title }}![Horse and Rider](NU_U17_09_03_003.png)

## Part 0 
Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on each foot of the horse inthe above figure (two are on the ground), assuming the centre of mass of the horse ismidway between the feet. The total mass of the horse and rider is ($m) (kg). 
## Part 1 
What is the minimum coefficient of friction between the hooves and ground? Note that the force exerted by the wall is horizontal.
