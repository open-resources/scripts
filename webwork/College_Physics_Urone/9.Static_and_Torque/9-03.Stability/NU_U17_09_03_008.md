# {{ params.vars.title }}![Torque on Drawbridge II](NU_U17_09_03_008.png)

## Part 0 
Suppose a ($mcar)-(kg) car parks on the ($mbridge)-(kg) bridge in the above figure with its center of mass halfway between the hinges and the cable attachments. (The bridge is supported by the cables and hinges only. Note that the diagram only shows one cable, but there are two cables, one on each side of the bridge's "bed.") 
## Part 1 
Find the tension in each of the two cables. 
## Part 2 
Find the direction of the force exerted by the hinges on the bridge.
