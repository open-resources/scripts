# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Two children of mass ($m1) (kg) and ($m2) (kg) sit balanced on a seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw. If the children are separated by a distance of ($r) (m), at what distance from the pivot point is the small child sitting in order to maintain the balance?
