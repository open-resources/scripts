# {{ params.vars.title }}![Drawbridge and Torque](NU_U17_09_03_007.png)

## Part 0 
Suppose the weight of the drawbridge in the above figure is supported entirely by its hingesand the opposite shore, so that its cables are slack. 
## Part 1 
What fraction of the weight is supported by the opposite shore if the point of support is directly beneath the cable attachments? 
## Part 2 
What is the direction and magnitude of the force the hinges exert on the bridge under these circumstances? The mass of the bridge is ($w) (kg).
