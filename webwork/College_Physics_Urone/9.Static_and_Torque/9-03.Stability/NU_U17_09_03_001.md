# {{ params.vars.title }}![Horse and Rider](NU_U17_09_03_001.png)

## Part 0 
Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in the figure above. Calculate the force exerted onthe wall assuming that force is horizontal. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal andopposite to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. The total mass ofthe horse and rider is ($m) (kg).
