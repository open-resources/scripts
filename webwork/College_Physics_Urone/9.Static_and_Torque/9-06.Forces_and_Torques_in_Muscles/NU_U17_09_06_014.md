# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Unreasonable Results: Suppose two children are using a uniform seesaw that is (3.00) (m) long and has its centre of mass over the pivot. The first child has a mass of ($weight1) (kg) and sits ($x1) (m) from the pivot. 
## Part 1 
Calculate where the second ($weight2) (kg) child must sit to balance the seesaw.
