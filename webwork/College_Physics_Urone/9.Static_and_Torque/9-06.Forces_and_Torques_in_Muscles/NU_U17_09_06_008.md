# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Foot](NU_U17_09_06_008.png)

## Part 0 
A ($m)-(kg) man stands on his toes by exerting an upward force through the Achilles tendon, as in the figure above. 
## Part 1 
What is the force in the Achilles tendon if he stands on one foot? 
## Part 2 
Calculate the force at the pivot of the simplified lever system shownâ€” that force is representative of forces in the ankle joint.
