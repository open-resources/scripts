# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
You have just planted a sturdy ($length2) (m)-tall palm tree in your front lawn for your mother'sbirthday. Your brother kicks a ($massgrams) (g) ball, which hits the top of the tree at a speed of ($velocity) (m/s) and stays in contact with it for ($timems) (ms). The ball falls to the ground near the base of the tree and the recoil of the tree is minimal. 
## Part 1 
What is the magnitude of the force on the tree? 
## Part 2 
The length of the sturdy section of the root is only ($lengthcm) (cm). Furthermore, the soil around the roots is loose and we can assume that an effective force is applied at the tip of the ($lengthcm) (cm) length. What is the magnitude of the effective force exerted by the end of the tip of the root to keep the tree from toppling? Assume the tree will be uprooted rather than bend.
