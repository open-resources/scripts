# {{ params.vars.title }}![Pushups and Force](NU_U17_09_06_012.png)

## Part 0 
What magnitude of force should the woman in the figure above exert on the floor with each hand todo a push-up? Assume that she moves up at a constant speed. 
## Part 1 
The triceps muscle at the back of her upper arm has an effective lever arm of (1.75) (cm), and she exerts force on the floor at a horizontal distance of (20.0) (cm) from the elbow joint. Calculate the magnitude of the force in each triceps muscle. 
## Part 2 
How much work does she do if her centre of mass rises (0.240) (m)? 
## Part 3 
What is her useful power output if she does (25) pushups in one minute?
