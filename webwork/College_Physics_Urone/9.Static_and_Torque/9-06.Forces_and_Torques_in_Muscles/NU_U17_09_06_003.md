# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Patella](NU_U17_09_06_003.png)

## Part 0 
The upper leg muscle (quadriceps) exerts a force of ($FQ) (N), which is carried by a tendon over the kneecap (the patella) at the angles shown in the figure above. Find the magnitude of the force exerted by the kneecap on the upper leg bone (the femur). 
## Part 1 
Find the direction of the force exerted by the kneecap on the upper leg bone (the femur).
