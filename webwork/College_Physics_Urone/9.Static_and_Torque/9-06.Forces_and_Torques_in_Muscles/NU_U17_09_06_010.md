# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Jaw](NU_U17_09_06_010.png)

## Part 0 
Unlike most of the other muscles in our bodies, the masseter muscle in the jaw, as illustrated in the figure above, is attached relatively far from the joint, enabling large forces to be exerted by the back teeth. 
## Part 1 
Using the information in the figure, calculate the force exerted by the teeth on the bullet. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the force on the joint.
