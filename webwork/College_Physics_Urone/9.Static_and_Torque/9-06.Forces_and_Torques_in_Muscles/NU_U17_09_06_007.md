# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Head](NU_U17_09_06_007.png)

## Part 0 
Even when the head is held erect, as in the figure above, its centre of mass is not directlyover the principal point of support (the atlanto-occipital joint). The muscles at theback of the neck should therefore exert a force to keep the head erect. That is whyyour head falls forward when you fall asleep in the class. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the force exerted by these muscles using the information in the figure. 
## Part 2 
What is the force exerted by the pivot on the head?
