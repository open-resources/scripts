# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Two children push on opposite sides of a door during play. Both push horizontally andperpendicular to the door. One child pushes with a force of ($F) (N) at a distance of($r1) (m) from the hinges, and the second child pushes at a distance of ($r2) (m). What force must the second child exert to keep the door from moving? Assume friction is negligible.
