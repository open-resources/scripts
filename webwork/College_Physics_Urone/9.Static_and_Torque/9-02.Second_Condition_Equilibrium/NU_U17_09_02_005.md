# {{ params.vars.title }}![Children on Seesaw](NU_U17_09_02_005.png)

## Part 0 
The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw. The leftmost child has a mass of ($m1) (kg) and sits ($r1) (m) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of ($m2) (kg). The seesaw has a mass ($ms) (kg) and a center of mass located($rs) (m) to the left of the pivot (on the side of the lighter child). 
## Part 1 
How far from the pivot does the heavier child sit? 
## Part 2 
Calculate (F_p), the supporting force exerted by the pivot.
