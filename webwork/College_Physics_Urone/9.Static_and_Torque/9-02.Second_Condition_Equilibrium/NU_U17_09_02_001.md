# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
When opening a door, you push on it perpendicularly with a force of ($F) (N) at adistance of ($r) (m) from the hinges. What torque are you exerting relative to thehinges? 
## Part 1 
Does it matter if you push at the same height as the hinges? Enter "yes" or "no":
