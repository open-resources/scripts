# {{ params.vars.title }}![Children on Seesaw.](NU_U17_09_02_004.png)

## Part 0 
The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass. The leftmost child has a mass of ($m1) (kg) and sits ($r1) (m) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of ($m2) (kg). Use the second condition for equilibrium to calculate (F_p).
