# {{ params.vars.title }}![Pulley System](NU_U17_09_05_007.png)

## Part 0 
If you used an ideal pulley of the type shown in the figure above having a mass of ($mps) (kg) to support a car engine of mass (115) (kg), 
## Part 1 
What is the tension in the rope? 
## Part 2 
What force must the ceiling supply, assuming you pull straight up on the rope?
