# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you needed to raise a ($m)-(kg) mower a distance of (6.00) (cm) above the ground to change a tire. If you had a ($r)-(m) long lever, where would you place the fulcrum if your force was limited to ($F) (N) and the mower was situated on the right end of the lever?
