# {{ params.vars.title }}![Wheelbarrow](NU_U17_09_05_003.png)

## Part 0 
What is the mechanical advantage of a wheelbarrow, such as the one in the figure above, if the centre of gravity of the wheelbarrow and its load has a perpendicular lever arm of ($lo) (cm), while the hands have a perpendicular lever arm of ($li) (m)? 
## Part 1 
What upward force should you exert to support the wheelbarrow and its load if their combined mass is ($m) (kg)? 
## Part 2 
What force does the wheel exert on the ground?
