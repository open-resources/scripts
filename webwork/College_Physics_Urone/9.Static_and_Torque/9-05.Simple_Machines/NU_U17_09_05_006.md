# {{ params.vars.title }}![Pulley System](NU_U17_09_05_006.png)

## Part 0 
If you used an ideal pulley of the type shown in the figure above to support a car engineof mass ($m) (kg), 
## Part 1 
What would be the tension in the rope? 
## Part 2 
What force must the ceiling supply, assuming you pull straight down on the rope? Neglect the pulley system's mass.
