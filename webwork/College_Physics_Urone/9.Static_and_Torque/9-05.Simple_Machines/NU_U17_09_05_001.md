# {{ params.vars.title }}![Nail Puller](NU_U17_09_05_001.png)

## Part 0 
What is the mechanical advantage of a nail puller—similar to the one shown in the figure above—where you exert a force ($d) (cm) from the pivot and the nail is ($d2) (cm) on the other side? 
## Part 1 
What minimum force must you exert to apply a force of ($Fb) (N) to the nail?
