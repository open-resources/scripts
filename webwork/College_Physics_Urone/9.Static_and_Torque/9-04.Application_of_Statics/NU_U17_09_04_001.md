# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
To get up on the roof, a person (mass ($mman) (kg)) places a ($length)-(m) aluminum ladder (mass ($mladder) (kg)) against the house on a concrete pad with the base of the ladder ($width) (m) from the house. The ladder rests against a plastic rain gutter, which we can assume to be frictionless. The centre of mass of the ladder is ($dladder) (m) from the bottom (<i>i.e.</i> ($dladder) (m) up its length). The person is standing ($dman) (m) from the bottom. What are the magnitudes of the forces on the ladder at the top and bottom?
