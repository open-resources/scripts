# {{ params.vars.title }}![Pole Vaulter](NU_U17_09_04_002.png)

## Part 0 
In the figure above, the centre of gravity of the pole held by the pole vaulter is ($h) (m) from the left hand, and the hands are ($l) (m) apart. The pole has mass ($m) (kg). Calculate the force exerted by 
## Part 1 
his right hand and 
## Part 2 
his left hand.
