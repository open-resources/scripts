# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An automobile engine can produce ($Torque) NÂ·m of torque. Calculate the angularacceleration produced if (95.0)% of this torque is applied to the drive shaft, axle, andrear wheels of a car, given the following information. The car is suspended so that thewheels can turn freely. Each wheel acts like a ($mass1) kg disk that has a ($radius1) m radius. The walls of each tire act like a ($mass2)-kg annular ring that has inside radius of ($radius1) m and outside radius of ($radius2) m. The tread of each tire acts like a ($mass3)-kg hoop of radius ($radius3) m. The ($mass4)-kg axle acts like a rod that has a ($radius4)-cm radius. The ($mass5)-kg drive shaft acts like a rod that has a ($radius5)-cm radius.
