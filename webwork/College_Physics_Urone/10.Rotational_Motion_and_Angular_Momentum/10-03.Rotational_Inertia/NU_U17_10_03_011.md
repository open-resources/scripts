# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An advertisement claims that an ($masscar)-kg car is aided by its($massfly)-kg flywheel, which can accelerate the car from rest to a speed of ($velocity) m/s. The flywheel is a disk with a ($radius)-m radius. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have if (95.0)% of its rotational energy is used to get the car up to speed. 
## Part 3 
Is this reasonable?
