# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A soccer player extends her lower leg in a kicking motion by exerting a force with the muscle above the knee in the front of her leg. She produces an angular acceleration of ($angularacceleration) (rad/s^2) and her lower leg has a moment of inertia of ($Inertia) (kg m^2). What is the force exerted by the muscle if its effective perpendicular lever arm is ($radius) cm?
