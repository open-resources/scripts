# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The triceps muscle in the back of the upper arm extends the forearm. This muscle in aprofessional boxer exerts a force of ($F times 10^3) N with an effective perpendicular lever arm of ($radius) cm, producing an angular acceleration of the forearm of ($angularacceleration rad/s^2). What is the moment of inertia of the boxer's forearm?
