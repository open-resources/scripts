## Part 0 
Starting with the formula for the moment of inertia of a rod rotated around an axisthrough one end perpendicular to its length ((I = Ml^2/3)), prove that the moment ofinertia of a rod rotated about an axis through its center perpendicular to its length is(I = Ml^2/12). You will find the graphics in Figure 10.12 useful in visualizing theserotations.
