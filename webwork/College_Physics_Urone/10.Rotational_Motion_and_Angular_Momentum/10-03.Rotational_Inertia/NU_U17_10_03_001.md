# {{ params.vars.title }}![Merry-go-round.](NU_U17_10_03_001.png)

## Part 0 
Consider the father pushing a playground merry-go-round as pictured above. He exerts a force of ($ForceN) on the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a ($radiusm) radius. Consider the merry-go-round itself to be a uniform disk with negligible retarding friction. 
## Part 1 
How long does it take the father to give the merry-go-round and his 18.0-kg child an angular velocity of ($angularvelocity) rad/s? 
## Part 2 
How many revolutions must he go through to generate this velocity? 
## Part 3 
If he exerts a slowing force of the same magnitude, how long would it take him to stop them?
