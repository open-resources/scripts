# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the moment of inertia of a skater given the following information. 
## Part 2 
The ($massa)-kg skater is approximated as a cylinder that has a ($radiusa)-m radius. 
## Part 3 
The skater with arms extended is approximately a cylinder that is ($mass2) kg, has a ($radiusa)-m radius, and has two ($radius2)-m-long arms which are ($mass3) kg each and extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated about their ends.
