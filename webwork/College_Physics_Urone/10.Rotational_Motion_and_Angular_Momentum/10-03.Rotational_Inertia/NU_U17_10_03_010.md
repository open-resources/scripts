# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Unreasonable Results A gymnast doing a forward flip lands on the mat and exerts a($Torque)-NÂ·m torque to slow and then reverse her angular velocity. Her initial angularvelocity is ($velocity) rad/s, and her moment of inertia is ($Inertia kg m^2). 
## Part 2 
What time is required for her to exactly reverse her spin?
