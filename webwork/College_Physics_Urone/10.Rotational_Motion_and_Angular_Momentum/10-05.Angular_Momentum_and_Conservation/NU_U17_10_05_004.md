# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A playground merry-go-round has a mass of ($MassWheel) kg and a radius of ($radius) m and it is rotating with an angular velocity of ($angularvelocity) rev/s. What is its angular velocity after a ($masschild)-kg child gets onto it by grabbing its outer edge? The child is initially at rest.
