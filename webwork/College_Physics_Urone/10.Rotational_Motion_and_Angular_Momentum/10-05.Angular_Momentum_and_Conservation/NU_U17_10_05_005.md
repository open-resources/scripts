# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Three children are riding on the edge of a merry-go-round that is ($Mass) kg, has a ($radius)- m radius, and is spinning at ($angularvelocity) rpm. The children have masses of ($mass1), ($mass2), and ($mass3) kg. If the child who has a mass of ($mass2) kg moves to the centre of the merry-go- round, what is the new angular velocity in rpm?
