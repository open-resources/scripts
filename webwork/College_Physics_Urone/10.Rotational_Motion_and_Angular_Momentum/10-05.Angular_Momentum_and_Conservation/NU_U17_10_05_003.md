# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose you start an antique car by exerting a force of ($Force) N on its crank for ($time) s. What angular momentum is given to the engine if the handle of the crank is ($radius) m from the pivot and the force is exerted to create maximum torque the entire time?
