# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A baseball pitcher throws the ball in a motion where there is rotation of the forearm about the elbow joint as well as other movements. If the linear velocity of the ball relative to the elbow joint is ($velocity) m/s at a distance of ($radius) m from the joint and the moment of inertia of the forearm is ($Inertia) (kg m^2) , what is the rotational kinetic energy of the forearm?
