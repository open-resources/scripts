# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In softball, the pitcher throws with the arm fully extended (straight at the elbow). In a fast pitch the ball leaves the hand with a speed of ($velocitykmh) km/h. 
## Part 2 
Find the rotational kinetic energy of the pitcher's arm given its moment of inertia is ($Inertia) (kg m^2) and the ball leaves the hand at a distance of ($length) m from the pivot at the shoulder. 
## Part 3 
What force did the muscles exert to cause the arm to rotate if their effective perpendicular lever arm is ($radiusb) cm and the ball is ($massb) kg?
