# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the moment of inertia of an object that rolls without slipping down a ($height)-m- high incline starting from rest, and has a final velocity of ($velocity) m/s? Express the moment of inertia as a multiple of (MR^2), where (M) is the mass of the object and (R) is its radius.
