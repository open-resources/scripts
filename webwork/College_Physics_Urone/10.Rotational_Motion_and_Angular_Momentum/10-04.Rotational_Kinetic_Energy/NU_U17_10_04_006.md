# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
While punting a football, a kicker rotates his leg about the hip joint. The moment of inertia of the leg is ($Inertia) (kg m^2) and its rotational kinetic energy is ($KineticEnergy) J. 
## Part 2 
What is the angular velocity of the leg? 
## Part 3 
What is the velocity of tip of the punter's shoe if it is ($radius) m from the hip joint?
