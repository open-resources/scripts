## Part 0 
An child jumps on 0.25 m from the edge of the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a 1.50 m radius. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the merry-go-round plus child when they have an angular velocity of ($angularvelocityrpm) rpm if the system's inertia is 84.38 Nm. 
## Part 2 
Using energy considerations, find the number of revolutions the child's father will have to push to achieve this angular velocity starting from rest if he pushes with a force of 250 N as shown above. 
## Part 3 
Again, using energy considerations, calculate the force the father must exert to stop the merry-go-round in two revolutions.
