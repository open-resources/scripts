# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
While exercising in a fitness centre, a man lies face down on a bench and lifts a weight with one lower leg by contracting the muscles in the back of the upper leg. 
## Part 2 
Find the angular acceleration produced given the mass lifted is ($mass) kg at a distance of ($radius) cm from the knee joint, the moment of inertia of the lower leg is ($Inertia) (kg m^2) , the muscle force is ($Force) N, and its effective perpendicular lever arm is ($Radius) cm. 
## Part 3 
How much work is done if the leg rotates through an angle of ($degree ^circ) with a constant force exerted by the muscle?
