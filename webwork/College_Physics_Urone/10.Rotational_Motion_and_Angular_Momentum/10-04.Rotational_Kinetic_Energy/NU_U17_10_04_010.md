# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
To develop muscle tone, a woman lifts a ($mass)-kg weight held in her hand. She uses her biceps muscle to flex the lower arm through an angle of ($degree ^circ). 
## Part 2 
What is the angular acceleration if the weight is ($radiusw) cm from the elbow joint, her forearm has a moment of inertia of ($Inertia) (kg m^2), and the muscle force is ($Force) N at an effective perpendicular lever arm of ($radius) cm? 
## Part 3 
How much work does she do?
