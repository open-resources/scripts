# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose a ($mass)-kg motorcycle has two wheels of mass 12.0-kg with aninner radius of 0.280 m and an outer radius of 0.330 m that behave like annular rings. It is heading toward a hill at a speed of ($velocity) m/s. 
## Part 2 
How high can it coast up the hill, if you neglect friction? 
## Part 3 
How much energy is lost to friction if the motorcycle only gains an altitude of ($heighto) m before coming to rest?
