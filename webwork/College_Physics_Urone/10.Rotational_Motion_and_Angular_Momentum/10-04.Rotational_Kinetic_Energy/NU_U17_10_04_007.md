# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A bus contains a ($massfly) kg flywheel (a disk that has a ($radius) m radius) and has a total mass of ($Massbus) kg. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have to contain enough energy to take the bus from rest to a speed of ($velocitya) m/s, assuming (90.0)% of the rotational kinetic energy can be transformed into translational energy. 
## Part 3 
How high a hill can the bus climb with this stored energy and still have a speed of ($velocityb) m/s at the top of the hill?
