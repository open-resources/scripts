## Part 0 
Twin skaters approach one another as shown above and lock hands. 
## Part 1 
Calculate their final angular velocity, given each had an initial speed of ($velocity) m/s relative to the ice. Each has a mass of ($mass) kg, and each has a centre of mass located ($radius) m from their locked hands. You may approximate their moments of inertia to be that of point masses at this radius. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the total kinetic energy of the system.
