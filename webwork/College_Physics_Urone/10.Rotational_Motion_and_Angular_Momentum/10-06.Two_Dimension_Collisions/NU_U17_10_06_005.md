## Part 0 
Suppose the disk pictured above has a mass of 50.0 g and an initial velocity of 30.0 m/s when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg. 
## Part 1 
The nail is removed and the stick is free to have translational motion as well as rotational motion. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the angular momentum that is conserved in the CM frame. 
## Part 3 
Calculate the final kinetic energy. 
## Part 4 
Calculate the linear momentum.
