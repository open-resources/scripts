## Part 0 
Suppose a ($massball)-kg ball is thrown at ($velocity) m/s to a motionless person standing on ice who catches it with an outstretched arm as shown above. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the final linear velocity of the person, given his mass is ($MassPerson) kg. 
## Part 2 
What is his angular velocity if each arm is ($massarm) kg? You may treat his arms as uniform rods (each has a length of ($length) m) and the rest of his body as a uniform cylinder of radius ($radiusb) m. Neglect the effect of the ball on his centre of mass so that his centre of mass remains in his geometrical centre. 
## Part 3 
Compare the initial kinetic energy and final kinetic energy by calculating both and inputting the final kinetic energy
