## Part 0 
Suppose the rotating disk shown above has a mass of 50.0 g, radius of 0.015 m, an initial velocity of 30.0 m/s and is spinning clockwise at (1000) rpm when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg. 
## Part 1 
What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision? 
## Part 2 
What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision? 
## Part 3 
What is the total linear momentum before and after the collision?
