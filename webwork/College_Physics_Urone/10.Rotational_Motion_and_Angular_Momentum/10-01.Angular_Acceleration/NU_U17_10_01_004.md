# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Unreasonable Results You are told that a basketball player spins the ball with anangular acceleration of ($angularacceleration rad/s^2). 
## Part 2 
What is the ball's final angular velocity if the ball starts from rest and the acceleration lasts ($time) s? 
## Part 3 
Is this reasonable?
