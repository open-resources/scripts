# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
You have a grindstone (a disk) that is ($mass) kg, has a ($radius)-m radius, and is turning at ($velocityrpm) rpm, and you press a steel axe against it with a radial force of ($N) N. 
## Part 2 
Assuming the kinetic coefficient of friction between steel and stone is ($uk), calculate the angular acceleration of the grindstone. 
## Part 3 
How many turns will the stone make before coming to rest?
