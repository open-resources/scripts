# {{ params.vars.title }}![Earth.](NU_U17_10_07_001.png)

## Part 0 
The axis of Earth makes a ($degree ^circ) angle with a direction perpendicular to the plane of Earth's orbit. As shown above, this axis precesses, making one complete rotation in ($year) y. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the change in angular momentum in half this time. 
## Part 2 
What is the average torque producing this change in angular momentum? 
## Part 3 
If this torque were created by a single force (it is not) acting at the most effective point on the equator, what would its magnitude be?
