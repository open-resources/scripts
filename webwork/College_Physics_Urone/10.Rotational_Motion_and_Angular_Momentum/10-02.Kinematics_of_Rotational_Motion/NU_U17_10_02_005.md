# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Everyday application: Suppose a yo-yo has a center shaft that has a ($radius) cm radiusand that its string is being pulled. 
## Part 2 
If the string is stationary and the yo-yoaccelerates away from it at a rate of ($acceleration1 m/s^2), what is the angular acceleration of the yo-yo? 
## Part 3 
What is the angular velocity after ($time) s if it starts from rest? 
## Part 4 
The outside radius of the yo-yo is ($radiusc) cm. What is the tangential acceleration of a point on its edge?
