# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
During a very quick stop, a car decelerates at ($acceleration1 m/s^2). 
## Part 2 
What is the angular acceleration of its ($radius)-m-radius tires, assuming they do not slip on the pavement? 
## Part 3 
How many revolutions do the tires make before coming to rest, given their initialangular velocity is ($angularvelocity) rad/s? 
## Part 4 
How long does the car take to stop completely? 
## Part 5 
What distance does the car travel in this time? 
## Part 6 
What was the car's initial velocity?
