# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An electric current through hydrogen gas produces several distinct wavelengths of visible light. What are the wavelengths of the hydrogen spectrum, if they form first-order maxima at angles of  ($a1) ,($a2)  ,($a3)  , and ($a4) degrees when projected on a diffraction grating having (5,000) lines per centimeter?
