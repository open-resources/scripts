# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A Heâ€“Ne laser beam is reflected from the surface of a CD onto a wall. The brightest spot is the reflected beam at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. However, fringes are also observed. If the wall is ($d , (m) from the CD, and the first fringe is ($fringe , (m) from the central maximum, what is the spacing of grooves on the CD? The He-Ne laser has a wavelength of (633 , (nm).
