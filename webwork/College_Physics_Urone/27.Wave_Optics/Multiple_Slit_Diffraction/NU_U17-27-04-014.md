# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Show that a diffraction grating cannot produce a second-order maximum for a given wavelength of light unless the first-order maximum is at an angle less than (30.0^circ). 
## Part 2 
If (dsin)(theta)<sub>1</sub> = (lambda) and if (dsin)(theta)<sub>2</sub> = (2)(lambda), solve this question by finding an <i>simplified expression</i> for (theta)<sub>1</sub>. Use "asin" for inverse sine.$PAR (theta)<sub>1</sub> = ans_rule(40)
