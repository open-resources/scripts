# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An aircraft maintenance technician walks past a tall hangar door that acts like a single slit for sound entering the hangar. Outside the door, on a line perpendicular to the opening in the door, a jet engine makes a ($freq , (Hz) sound. At what angle with the door will the technician observe the first minimum in sound intensity if the vertical opening is ($width , (m) wide and the speed of sound is (340 , (m/s)?
