# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A water break at the entrance to a harbor consists of a rock barrier with a ($width , m) wide opening. Ocean waves of ($wave , m) wavelength approach the opening straight on. At what angle to the incident direction are the boats inside the harbor most protected against wave action?
