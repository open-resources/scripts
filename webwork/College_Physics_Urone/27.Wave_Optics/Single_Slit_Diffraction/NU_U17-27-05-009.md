# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Find the angle between the first minima for the two sodium vapor lines, which have wavelengths of ($wave) and ($wave2 (nm), when they fall upon a single slit of width ($width times 10^-6 , (m). 
## Part 2 
What is the distance between these minima if the diffraction pattern falls on a screen ($d , (m) from the slit?
