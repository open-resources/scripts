# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The planet Pluto and its Moon Charon are separated by (19,600 , (km). Neglecting atmospheric effects, at what distance will the (5.08 , (m) diameter Mount Palomar telescope be able to resolve these bodies when they are (4.50 times 10^9 , (km) from Earth? Assume an average wavelength of ($wave , (nm). 
## Part 2 
The telescope should be able to discern a separation at : ans_rule(10) (m).
