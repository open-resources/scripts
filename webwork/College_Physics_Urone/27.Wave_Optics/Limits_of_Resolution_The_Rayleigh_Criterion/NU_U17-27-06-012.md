# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An amateur astronomer wants to build a telescope with a diffraction limit that will allow him to see if there are people on the moons of Jupiter. What diameter mirror is needed to be able to see (1.00 , (m) detail on a Jovian Moon at a distance of (7.50 times 10^8 , (km) from Earth? The wavelength of light averages ($wave , (nm).
