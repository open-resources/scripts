# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The (300 , (m) diameter Arecibo radio telescope detects radio waves with a ($wave , (cm) average wavelength. 
## Part 2 
What is the angle between two just-resolvable point sources for this telescope? 
## Part 3 
How close together could these point sources be at the ($ly) million light year distance of the Andromeda galaxy?$BR$BRans_rule(40) (light years)$BR$BR
