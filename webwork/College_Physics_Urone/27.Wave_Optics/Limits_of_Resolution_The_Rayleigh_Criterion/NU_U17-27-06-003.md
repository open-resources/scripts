# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Diffraction spreading for a flashlight is insignificant compared with other limitations in its optics, such as spherical aberrations in its mirror. To show this, calculate the minimum angular spreading of a flashlight beam that is originally ($d , (cm) in diameter with an average wavelength of ($wave , (nm).
