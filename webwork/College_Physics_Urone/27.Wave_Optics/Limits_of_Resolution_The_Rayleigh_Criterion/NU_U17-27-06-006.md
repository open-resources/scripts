# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The limit to the eye's acuity is actually related to diffraction by the pupil. 
## Part 2 
What is the angle between two just-resolvable points of light for a ($d , (mm) diameter pupil, assuming an average wavelength of ($wave , (nm)? 
## Part 3 
Take your result to be the practical limit for the eye. What is the greatest possible distance a car can be from you if you can resolve its two headlights, given they are (1.30 , (m) apart? 
## Part 4 
What is the distance between two just-resolvable points held at an arm's length of (0.800 , (m) from your eye?
