# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A telescope can be used to enlarge the diameter of a laser beam and limit diffraction spreading. The laser beam is sent through the telescope in opposite the normal direction and can then be projected onto a satellite or the Moon. 
## Part 2 
If this is done with the Mount Wilson telescope, producing a ($d , (m) diameter beam of ($wave , (nm) light, what is the minimum angular spread of the beam? 
## Part 3 
Neglecting atmospheric effects, what is the size of the spot this beam would make on the Moon, assuming a lunar distance of (3.84 times 10^8 , (m)?
