# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
On a day when the intensity of sunlight is (1.00 , (kW/m^2), a circular lens ($d , (m) in diameter focuses light onto water in a black beaker. Two polarizing sheets of plastic are placed in front of the lens with their axes at an angle of ($angle^circ). Assuming the sunlight is unpolarized and the polarizers are (100 , (%)  efficient, what is the initial rate of heating of the water in (^circC/s) , assuming it is (80 , (%)  absorbed? The aluminum beaker has a mass of ($mass) grams and contains ($volume) grams of water.
