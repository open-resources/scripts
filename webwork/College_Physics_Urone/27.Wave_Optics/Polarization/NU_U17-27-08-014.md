# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If (x) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from the top of an interface between two substances, and (y) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from below, prove that (x) + (y) = (90.0^circ). 
## Part 2 
Use (n) to represent (n)<sub>1</sub>, and use (N) to represent (n)<sub>2</sub> 
## Part 3 
(tan(x)) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 4 
(tan(y)) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 5 
Using trigonometric identities to equate the two expressions above; 
## Part 6 
(tan(x)) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 7 
In terms of (y), angle (x) equals ans_rule(40) 
## Part 8 
Therefore, (x) + (y) equal ans_rule(40)
