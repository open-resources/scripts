# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The intensity of polarized light is reduced to (90.0 , (%) of its original value by passing through a polarizing filter with its axis at an angle of  (18.4^circ) to the direction of polarization. Verify this statement. 
## Part 2 
Enter the equivalence statement. If you need to raise (cos)(theta) to an exponent, put the entire term in parentheses. Enter angle (theta) as "(x)". 
## Part 3 
(I)/(I)<sub>o</sub> = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 4 
Now substitute an angle of (18.4^circ) into the expression above (recall that WebWorks evaluates in radians); 
## Part 5 
Express this value as a percent with two significant figures;
