# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose you put on two pairs of Polaroid sunglasses with their axes at an angle of ($angle^circ) . How much longer will it take the light to deposit a given amount of energy in your eye compared with a single pair of sunglasses? Assume the lenses are clear except for their polarizing characteristics.
