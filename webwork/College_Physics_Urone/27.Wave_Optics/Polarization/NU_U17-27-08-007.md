# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Prove that, if (I) is the intensity of light transmitted by two polarizing filters with axes at an angle (theta) and (I') is the intensity when the axes are at an angle (90.0^circ) - (theta) , then (I) + (I') = (I)<sub>o</sub> , the original intensity. 
## Part 2 
Enter expressions for (I) and (I'). Enter (I)<sub>o</sub> as (i) and angle (theta) as (x). Enter any numerical values with two significant figures, 
## Part 3 
(I) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 4 
(I') = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 5 
Combine the two equations above without simplifying, (I) + (I') = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 6 
Using trigonometric identities and factoring, this becomes (I) + (I') = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 7 
Now simplifying, (I) + (I') = ans_rule(40)
