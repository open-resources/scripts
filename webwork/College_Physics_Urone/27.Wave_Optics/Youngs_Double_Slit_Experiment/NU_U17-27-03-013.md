## Part 0 
The figure above shows a double slit located a distance (x) from a screen, with the distance from the centre of the screen given by (y). When the distance (d) between the slits is relatively large, there will be numerous bright spots, called fringes. Show that, for small angles (where (sin)((theta)) is approximately equal to (theta), with (theta) in radians), the distance between fringes is given by (Delta)(y) = (x)(lambda)/(d). 
## Part 1 
For two adjacent fringes, enter (lambda) as (w) and (m) as (m); 
## Part 2 
(dsin)(theta)<sub>m</sub> = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 3 
(dsin)(theta)<sub>m+1</sub> = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 4 
Subtracting the two equations gives; 
## Part 5 
(d)((sin)(theta)<sub>m+1</sub> - (sin)(theta)<sub>m</sub>)= ans_rule(40) 
## Part 6 
(d)((theta)<sub>m+1</sub> - (theta)<sub>m</sub>) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 7 
Entering (x) and (y) as their respective side lengths, (tan)(theta)<sub>m</sub> = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 8 
(lambda) = ans_rule(40) 
## Part 9 
(Delta)(y) = ans_rule(40)
