# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If the first-order maximum for pure-wavelength light falling on a double slit is at an angle of ($angle^circ), at what angle is the second-order maximum? 
## Part 2 
What is the angle of the first minimum? 
## Part 3 
What is the highest-order maximum possible here?
