# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In a lab, two glass slides are illuminated by pure-wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on a ($d , (mm) diameter hair at the other end, forming a wedge of air. How far apart are the dark bands, if the slides are ($long , (cm) long and ($wave , (nm) light is used?
