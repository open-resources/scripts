# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
In a Millikan oil-drop experiment, a ($voltage , (V) potential difference is applied to plates separated by ($distance , (cm). 
## Part 2 
What is the mass of an oil drop having two extra electrons that is suspended motionless by the field between the plates? 
## Part 3 
What is the diameter of the drop, assuming it is a sphere with the density of olive oil?
