# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What is the distance between the slits of a diffraction grating that produces a first-order maximum for the first Balmer line at an angle of ($angle^circ)? 
## Part 2 
At what angle will the fourth line of the Balmer series appear in first order? 
## Part 3 
At what angle will the second-order maximum be for the first line?
