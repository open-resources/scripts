# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Particles called muons exist in cosmic rays and can be created in particle accelerators. Muons are very similar to electrons, having the same charge and spin, but they have a mass (207) times greater. When muons are captured by anatom, they orbit just like an electron but with a smaller radius, since the mass in (a_B=frach^24pi^2m_ekq_e^2=0.529times 10^-10) (m) is (207 m_e). 
## Part 2 
Calculate the radius of the (n = 1) orbit for a muon in a uranium ion ((Z = 92)).
