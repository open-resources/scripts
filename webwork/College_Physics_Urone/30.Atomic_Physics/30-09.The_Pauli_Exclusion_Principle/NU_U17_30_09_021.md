# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A neighboring galaxy rotates on its axis so that stars on one side move toward us as fast as ($speed , (km/s), while those on the other side move away as fast as ($speed , (km/s). This causes the EM radiation we receive to be Doppler shifted by velocities over the entire range of (pm $speed , (km/s). What range of wavelengths will we observe for the (656.0 , (nm) line in the Balmer series of hydrogen emitted by stars in this galaxy. (This is called line broadening.) 
## Part 2 
The range is from ans_rule(10)(nm) (toward) to ans_rule(10) (nm) (away)
