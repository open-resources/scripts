# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A student in a physics laboratory observes a hydrogen spectrum with a diffraction grating for the purpose of measuring the wavelengths of the emitted radiation. In the spectrum, she observes a yellow line and finds its wavelength to be ($wavelength , (nm). 
## Part 2 
Assuming this is part of the Balmer series, determine (n)<sub>i</sub>, the principal quantum number of the initial state.
