# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A pulsar is a rapidly spinning remnant of a supernova. It rotates on its axis, sweeping hydrogen along with it so that hydrogen on one side moves toward us as fast as ($speed , (km/s), while that on the other side moves away as fast as ($speed , (km/s). This means that the EM radiation we receive will be Doppler shifted over a range of (pm $speed , (km/s) . What range of wavelengths will we observe for the (91.20 , (nm) line in the Lyman series of hydrogen? (Such line broadening is observed and actually provides part of the evidence for rapid rotation.) 
## Part 2 
The range is from ans_rule(10) (nm) (toward) to ans_rule(10) (nm) (away)
