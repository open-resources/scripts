# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A color television tube also generates some x rays when its electron beam strikes the screen. What is the shortest wavelength of these x rays, if a ($voltage , (kV) potential is used to accelerate the electrons? (Note that TVs have shielding to prevent these x rays from exposing viewers.)
