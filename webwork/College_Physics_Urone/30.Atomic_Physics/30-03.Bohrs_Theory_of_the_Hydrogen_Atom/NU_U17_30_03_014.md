# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A beryllium ion with a single electron (denoted (Be)<sup>3+</sup> ) is an excited state with radius the same as that of the ground state of hydrogen. 
## Part 2 
What is (n) for the (Be)<sup>3+</sup> ion? 
## Part 3 
How much energy in (eV) is needed to ionize the ion from this excited state?
