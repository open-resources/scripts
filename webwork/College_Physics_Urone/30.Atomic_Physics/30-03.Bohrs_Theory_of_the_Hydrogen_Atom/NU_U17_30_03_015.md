# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Atoms can be ionized by thermal collisions, such as at the high temperatures found in the solar corona. One such ion is (C)<sup>+5</sup>, a carbon atom with only a single electron. 
## Part 2 
By what factor are the energies of its hydrogen-like levels greater than those of hydrogen? 
## Part 3 
What is the wavelength of the first line in this ion's Paschen series?
