# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Loudspeakers can produce intense sounds with surprisingly small energy input in spiteof their low efficiencies. Calculate the power input needed to produce a ($dB , (dB) soundintensity level for a ($dcm , (cm) diameter speaker that has an efficiency of ($efficiency , (%). (This value is the sound intensity level right at the speaker.)
