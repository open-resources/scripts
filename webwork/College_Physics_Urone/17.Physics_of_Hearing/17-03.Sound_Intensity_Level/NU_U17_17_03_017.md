# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Ear trumpets were never very common, but they did aid people with hearing losses by gathering sound over a large area and concentrating it on the smaller area of the eardrum. What decibel increase does an ear trumpet produce if its sound gathering area is ($At cm^2) and the area of the eardrum is ($Ae cm^2), but the trumpet only has an efficiency of ($efficiency , (% ) in transmitting the sound to the eardrum?
