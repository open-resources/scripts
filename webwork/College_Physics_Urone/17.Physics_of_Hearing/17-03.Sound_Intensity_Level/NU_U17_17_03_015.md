# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If a sound intensity level of (0 , (dB) at (1000 , (Hz) corresponds to a maximum gauge pressure (sound amplitude) of (10^-9 , (atm), what is the maximum gauge pressure in a ($dBa , (dB) sound? 
## Part 2 
If a sound intensity level of (0 , (dB) at (1000 , (Hz) corresponds to a maximum gauge pressure (sound amplitude) of (10^-9 , (atm), what is the maximum gauge pressure in a ($dBb , (dB) sound?
