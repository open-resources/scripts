# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose a person has a ($dB , (dB) hearing loss at all frequencies. By how many factors of (10) will low-intensity sounds need to be amplified to seem normal to this person? Note that smaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further hearing damage.
