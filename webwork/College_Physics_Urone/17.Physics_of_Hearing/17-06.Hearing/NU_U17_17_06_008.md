# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
What sound intensity levels must sounds of frequencies (60 , (Hz) have in order to have the same loudness as a (40 , (dB) sound of frequency (1000 , (Hz) (that is, to have a loudness of (40) phons)? 
## Part 2 
What sound intensity levels must sounds of frequencies (3000 , (Hz) have in order to have the same loudness as a (40 , (dB) sound of frequency (1000 , (Hz) (that is, to have a loudness of (40) phons)? 
## Part 3 
What sound intensity levels must sounds of frequencies (8000 , (Hz) have in order to have the same loudness as a (40 , (dB) sound of frequency (1000 , (Hz) (that is, to have a loudness of (40) phons)?
