# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If a woman needs an amplification of (5.0 times 10^12) times the threshold intensity to enable her to hear at all frequencies, what is her overall hearing loss in (dB)? Note thatsmaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further damageto her hearing from levels above (90 , (dB).
