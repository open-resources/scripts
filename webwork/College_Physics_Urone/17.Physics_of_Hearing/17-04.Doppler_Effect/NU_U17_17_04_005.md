# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A commuter train blows its ($fs , (Hz) horn as it approaches a crossing. The speed ofsound is ($vw , (m/s). 
## Part 2 
An observer waiting at the crossing receives a frequency of ($fobs , (Hz). What is the speed of the train? 
## Part 3 
What frequency does the observer receive as the train moves away? 


### Answer Section
