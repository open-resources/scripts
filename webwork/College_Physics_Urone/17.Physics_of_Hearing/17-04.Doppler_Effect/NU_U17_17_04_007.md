# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Two eagles fly directly toward one another, the first at ($vo1 , (m/s) and the second at ($vo2 , (m/s). Both screech, the first one emitting a frequency of ($fs1 , (Hz) and the second one emitting a frequency of ($fs2 , (Hz). What frequency does the first eagle receive if the speed of sound is ($vw , (m/s)? 
## Part 2 
What frequency does the second eagle?
