# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Echo times are measured by diagnostic ultrasound scanners to determinedistances to reflecting surfaces in a patient. What is the difference in echo times fortissues that are ($d1cm) and ($d2cm) (cm) beneath the surface? (This difference is theminimum resolving time for the scanner to see details as small as (0.100 , (cm), or (1.00 , (mm). Discrimination of smaller time differences is needed to see smaller details.) 
## Part 2 
Discuss whether the period (T) of this ultrasound must be smaller than the minimumtime resolution. If so, what is the minimum frequency of the ultrasound and is that outof the normal range for diagnostic ultrasound?
