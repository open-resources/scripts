# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Ultrasound reflected from an oncoming bloodstream that is moving at ($vbcm , (cm/s) ismixed with the original frequency of ($fMHz , (MHz) to produce beats. What is the beatfrequency? (Assume that the frequency of ($fMHz , (MHz) is accurate to seven significantfigures.)
