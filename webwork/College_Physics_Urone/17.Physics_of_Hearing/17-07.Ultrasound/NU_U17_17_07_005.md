<strong>If you don't solve this problem correctly in $showHint tries, you can get a hint.</strong>$BRIn the clinical use of ultrasound, transducers are always coupled to the skin by a thinlayer of gel or oil, replacing the air that would otherwise exist between the transducerand the skin. $BRa) Using the values of acoustic impedance given in Table 17.5 (found in section 17.7) calculate the intensity reflection coefficient between transducer material and air. $BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$alphaA"));b) Calculate the intensity reflection coefficient between transducer material and gel (assuming for this problem that its acoustic impedance is identical to that of water). $BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
