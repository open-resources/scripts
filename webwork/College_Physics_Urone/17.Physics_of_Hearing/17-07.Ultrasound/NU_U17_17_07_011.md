# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A dolphin is able to tell in the dark that the ultrasound echoes received from twosharks come from two different objects only if the sharks are separated by ($d , (m),one being that much farther away than the other. 
## Part 2 
If the ultrasound has a frequency of ($fkHz , (kHz), show this ability is not limited by its wavelength. 
## Part 3 
If this ability is due to the dolphin's ability to detect the arrival times of echoes, what is the minimum time difference the dolphin can perceive?
