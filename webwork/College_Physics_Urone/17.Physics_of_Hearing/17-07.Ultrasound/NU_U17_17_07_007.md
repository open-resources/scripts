# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Find the size of the smallest detail observable in human tissue with ($fMHz , (MHz)ultrasound. 
## Part 2 
Is its effective penetration depth great enough to examine the entire eye (about (3.00) (cm) is needed)? 
## Part 3 
What is the wavelength of such ultrasound in (0 ^circ(C) air?
