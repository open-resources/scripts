# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A diagnostic ultrasound echo is reflected from moving blood and returns with afrequency ($fs , (Hz) higher than its original ($fMHz , (MHz). What is the velocity of the blood?(Assume that the frequency of ($fMHz , (MHz) is accurate to seven significant figures and($fs , (Hz) is accurate to three significant figures.)
