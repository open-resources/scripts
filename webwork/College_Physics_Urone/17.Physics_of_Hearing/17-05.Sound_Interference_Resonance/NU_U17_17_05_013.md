# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Calculate the first overtone in an ear canal, which resonates like a ($Lcm , (cm) long tube closed at one end, by taking air temperature to be ($TC ^circ(C). Is the ear particularly sensitive to such a frequency? (The resonances of the ear canal are complicated by its nonuniform shape, which we shall ignore.)
