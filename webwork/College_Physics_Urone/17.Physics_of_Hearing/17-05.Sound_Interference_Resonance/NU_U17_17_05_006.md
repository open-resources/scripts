# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
If a wind instrument, such as a tuba, has a fundamental frequency of ($f1 , (Hz), whatis its first overtone? It is closed at one end. (The overtones of a real tuba aremore complex than this example, because it is a tapered tube.) 
## Part 2 
What is its second overtone? 
## Part 3 
What is its third overtone?
