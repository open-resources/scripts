# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Two point charges q1 and q2 are ($r2) m apart, and their total charge is ($q1q2) Î¼C 
## Part 2 
If the force of repulsion between them is ($F) N, what are magnitudes of the two charges? 
## Part 3 
If one charge attracts the other with a force of (0.525) N, what are the magnitudes of the two charges?
