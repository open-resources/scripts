# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Common static electricity involves charges ranging from nanocoulombs to microcoulombs. 
## Part 2 
How strong is the attractive force between a glass rod with a ($a) μC charge and a silk cloth with a (-$c) μC charge, which are ($e) cm apart, using the approximation that they act like point charges?
