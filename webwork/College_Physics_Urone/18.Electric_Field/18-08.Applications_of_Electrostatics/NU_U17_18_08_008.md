# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
An electron has an initial velocity of ($vo times 10^6) m/s in a uniform ($E times 10^5) N/C strength electric field. The field accelerates the electron in the direction opposite to its initial velocity. 
## Part 2 
How far does the electron travel before coming to rest? 
## Part 3 
How long does it take the electron to come to rest? 
## Part 4 
What is the electron's velocity when it returns to its starting point?
