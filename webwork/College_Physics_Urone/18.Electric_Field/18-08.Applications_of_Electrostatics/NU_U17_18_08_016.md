# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A wrecking yard inventor wants to pick up cars by charging a ($d) m diameter ball and inducing an equal and opposite charge on the car. If a car has a ($m) kg mass and the ball is to be able to lift it from a distance of ($r1) m: 
## Part 2 
What minimum charge must be used? 
## Part 3 
What is the electric field near the surface of the ball?
