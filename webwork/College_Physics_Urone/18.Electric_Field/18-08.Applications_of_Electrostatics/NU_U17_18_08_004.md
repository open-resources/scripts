# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Earth has a net charge that produces an electric field of approximately ($E) N/C downward at its surface. 
## Part 2 
What is the magnitude and sign of the excess charge, noting the electric field of a conducting sphere is equivalent to a point charge at its centre? 
## Part 3 
What acceleration will the field produce on a free electron near Earth's surface? 
## Part 4 
What mass object with a single extra electron will have its weight supported by this field?
