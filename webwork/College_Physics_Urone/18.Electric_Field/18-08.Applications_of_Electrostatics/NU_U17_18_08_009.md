# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The practical limit to an electric field in air is about ($Ea times 10^6) N/C . Above this strength, sparking takes place because air begins to ionize and charges flow, reducing the field. 
## Part 2 
Calculate the distance a free proton must travel in this field to reach ($percentconstant) % of the speed of light, starting from rest.
