# {{ params.vars.title }}![Positions of point charges.](NU_U17_18_07_001.png)

## Part 0 
Find the total electric field of line (a) at (x=5.00,cm) as shown in the above image given that (q=1.00,muC). 
## Part 1 
At what position between (3.00) and (8.00,cm) is the total electric field the same as that for (-2q) alone? 
## Part 2 
Can the electric field be zero anywhere between 0 and 8 cm? 
## Part 3 
Enter 0 for yes and 1 for no. 
## Part 4 
At very large positive and negative values of x, the electric field approaches zero on lines (a) and (b). In which does it most rapidly approach zero? 
## Part 5 
Enter 0 for (a) and 1 for (b). 
## Part 6 
At what position to the right of 11cm is the total electric field zero, other than at infinity?
