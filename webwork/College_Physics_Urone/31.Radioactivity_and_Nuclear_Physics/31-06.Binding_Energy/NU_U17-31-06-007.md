## Part 2 
Click  htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" )  to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 3 
The purpose of this problem is to show in three ways that the binding energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom is negligible compared with the masses of the proton and electron. 
## Part 4 
Calculate the mass equivalent of the ($binding_energy , eV) binding energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom. 
## Part 5 
Subtract the mass of a proton from the mass of a hydrogen atom. You will find the difference is equal to the electron's mass to three digits, implying the binding energy is small in comparison. 
## Part 6 
Take the ratio of the binding energy of the electron, ($binding_energy , eV), to the energy equivalent of the electron's mass.
