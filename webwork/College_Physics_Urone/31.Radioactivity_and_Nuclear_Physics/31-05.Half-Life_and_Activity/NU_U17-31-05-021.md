# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is ($mass , kg) of(:^2 3 8Pu), a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the ($MeV , MeV , alpha) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of(:^2 3 8Pu) is(:$thalf) years. 
## Part 1 
What was the original activity of the(:Pu)? 
## Part 2 
What power was emitted in kilowatts? 
## Part 3 
What power was emitted ($y) years after launch? You may neglect any extra energy from daughter nuclides and any losses from escaping (gamma) rays.
