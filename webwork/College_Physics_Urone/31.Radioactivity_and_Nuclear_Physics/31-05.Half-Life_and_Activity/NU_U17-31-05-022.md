# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is ($mass) kg of (^238)Pu, a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the ($MeV)-MeV (alpha) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of (^238)Pu is ($thalf) years. $BRa) What was the original activity of the (^238)Pu in becquerel? $BR$BRans_rule(40) Bq $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Ro"));b) What power was emitted in kilowatts?  $BR$BRans_rule(40) kW$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Po"));c) What power was emitted ($y) y after launch? You may neglect any extra energy from daughter nuclides and any losses from escaping (gamma) rays. $BR$BRans_rule(40) kW$BR$BR
