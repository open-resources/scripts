# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A nuclear physicist finds ($mass) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;g</span> of(:^2 3 6 U) in a piece of uranium ore and assumes it is primordial since its half-life is(:2.3 times 10^7) years. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the amount of(:^2 3 6U) that would had to have been on Earth when it formed(:4.5 times 10^9) years ago for ($mass) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;g</span> to be left today.
