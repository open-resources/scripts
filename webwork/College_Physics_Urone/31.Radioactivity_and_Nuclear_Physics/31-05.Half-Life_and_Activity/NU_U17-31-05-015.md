# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
The (beta^-) particles emitted in the decay of (, ^3H) (tritium) interact with matter to create light in a glow-in-the-dark exit sign. At the time of manufacture, such a sign contains ($activity_1Ci , Ci) of (, ^3H). 
## Part 2 
What is the mass of the tritium? 
## Part 3 
BEGIN_HINTCan you first rearrange the relationship between 
## Part 4 
<b>i.</b> activity, 
## Part 5 
<b>ii.</b> half-life,$PAR <b>iii.</b> and the number of radioactive nuclei 
## Part 6 
to solve for <b>iii.</b>?END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$mass")); 
## Part 7 
What is its activity(,$time) years after manufacture?
