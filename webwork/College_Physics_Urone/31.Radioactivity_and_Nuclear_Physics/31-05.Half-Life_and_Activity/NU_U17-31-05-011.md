# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
A tree falls in a forest. How many years must pass before the (,^14C) activity in ($mass_g , g) of the tree's carbon drops to ($activity) decays per hour? Take the percent abundance of (,^14C) to be (1.30 times 10^-10 , %).
