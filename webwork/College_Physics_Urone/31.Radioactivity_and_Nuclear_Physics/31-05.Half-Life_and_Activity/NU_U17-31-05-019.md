# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
The ceramic glaze on a red-orange Fiestaware plate is(:U_2 O_3) and contains ($mass , g) of(:^2 3 8U), but very little(:^2 3 5U). 
## Part 2 
What is the activity of the plate? 
## Part 3 
Calculate the total energy that will be released by the(:^2 3 8U) decay. The energy released per decay is(:$decay , MeV). 
## Part 4 
If energy is worth ($cents) cents per (kW cdot (h), what is the monetary value of the energy emitted? (These plates went out of production some thirty years ago, but are still available as collectibles.)
