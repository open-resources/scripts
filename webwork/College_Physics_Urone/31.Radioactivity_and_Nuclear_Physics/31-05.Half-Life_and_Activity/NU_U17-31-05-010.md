Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
You can sometimes find deep red crystal vases in antique stores, called uranium glass because their colour was produced by doping the glass with uranium. Calculate the activity of such a vase assuming it has ($massU , g) of uranium in it. Neglect the activity of any daughter nuclides.
