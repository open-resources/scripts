# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
A (,^60Co) source is labeled ($activity1_mCi , mCi), but its present activity is found to be ($activity2_Bq times 10^7 , Bq). 
## Part 2 
What is the present activity in (mCi)? 
## Part 3 
How long ago did it actually have a ($activity1_mCi , mCi) activity?
