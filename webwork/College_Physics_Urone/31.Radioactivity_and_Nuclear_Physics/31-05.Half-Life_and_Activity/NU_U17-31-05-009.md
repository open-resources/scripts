# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
(,^50V) has one of the longest known radioactive half-lives. In a difficult experiment, a researcher found that the activity of ($massSI , kg) of (,^50V) is ($activitySI , Bq). What is the half-life in years? Take the molar mass of vanadium to be (50.94 ,fracgmol).
