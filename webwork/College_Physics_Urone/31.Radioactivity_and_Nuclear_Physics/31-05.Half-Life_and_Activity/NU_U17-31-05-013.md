Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
A ($activity_1SI , Ci ) (,^60Co) source used for cancer therapy is considered too weak to be useful when its activity falls to ($activity_2SI , Ci). How long after its manufacture does this happen?
