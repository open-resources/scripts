Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the activity of the (,^14C) in ($mass , g) of (,^12C), as found in living tissue. Take the percent abundance of (,^14C) to be (1.30 times 10^-10 %).
