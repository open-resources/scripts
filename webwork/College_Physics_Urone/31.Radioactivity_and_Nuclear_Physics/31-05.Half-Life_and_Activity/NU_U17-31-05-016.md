## Part 0 
Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
World War II aircraft had instruments with glowing radium-painted dials, as shown in the figure above. The activity of one such instrument was ($activity_1 times 10^5 , Bq) when new. 
## Part 2 
$PAR a) What mass of (,^$MRa) was present? 
## Part 3 
BEGIN_HINTCan you first rearrange the relationship between 
## Part 4 
<b>i.</b> activity, 
## Part 5 
<b>ii.</b> half-life,$PAR <b>iii.</b> and the number of radioactive nuclei 
## Part 6 
to solve for <b>iii.</b>?END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$mass")); 
## Part 7 
After some years, the phosphors on the dials deteriorated chemically, but the radium did not escape. What is the activity of this instrument(,$time) years after it was made?
