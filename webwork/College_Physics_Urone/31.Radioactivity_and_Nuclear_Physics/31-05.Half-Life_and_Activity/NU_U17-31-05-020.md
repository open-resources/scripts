Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
Large amounts of depleted uranium(:^2 3 8U) are available as a by-product of uranium processing for reactor fuel and weapons. Uranium is very dense and makes good counter weights for aircraft. Suppose you have a ($mass , kg) block of(:^2 3 8U). 
## Part 2 
Find its activity. 
## Part 3 
How many calories per day are generated by thermalization of the decay energy? The energy released per decay is(:4.27 , MeV).
