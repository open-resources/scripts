# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> The manufacturer of a smoke alarm decides that the smallest  current of (alpha) radiation he can detect is ($current) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A</span>. 
## Part 1 
Find the activity of an (alpha) emitter that produces a ($current) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A</span> current of (alpha) particles.
