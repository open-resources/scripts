Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
Cow's milk produced near nuclear reactors can be tested for as little as ($activity , pCi) of (,^131I) to check for possible reactor leakage. What mass of (, ^131I) has this activity?
