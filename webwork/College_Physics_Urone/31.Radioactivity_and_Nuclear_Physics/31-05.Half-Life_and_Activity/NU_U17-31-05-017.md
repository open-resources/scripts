## Part 1 
The (,^210Po) source used in a physics laboratory is labeled as having an activity of ($activity_1uCi) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;Ci</span> on the date it was prepared. A student measures the radioactivity of this source with a Geiger counter and observes ($activity_observed) counts per minute. She notices that the source was prepared ($time) days before her lab. What fraction of the decays is she observing with her apparatus?
