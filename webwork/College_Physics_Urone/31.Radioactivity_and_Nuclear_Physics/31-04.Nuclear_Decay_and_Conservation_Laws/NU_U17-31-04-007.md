# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the (alpha) decay of (,^210Po), the isotope of polonium in the decay series of (,^238U) that was discovered by the Curies. A favorite isotope in physics labs, it has a short half-life and decays to a stable nuclide. 
## Part 1 
<center>(^210_84Po_126 ,, longrightarrow ,, ^a_bPb_c ,, + ,, ^4_2He_2)</center> 
## Part 2 
(a) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 3 
(b) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 4 
(c) = ans_rule(10)
