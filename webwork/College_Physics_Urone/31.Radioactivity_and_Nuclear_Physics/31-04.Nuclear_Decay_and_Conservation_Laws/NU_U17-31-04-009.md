# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the (beta^-) decay producing (,^137Ba). The parent nuclide is a major waste product of reactors and has chemistry similar to potassium and sodium, resulting in its concentration in your cells if ingested. 
## Part 1 
<center>(^a_bCs_c ,, longrightarrow ,, ^137_56Ba_81 ,, + ,, beta^- ,, + ,, overlinenu_e)</center> 
## Part 2 
(a) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 3 
(b) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 4 
(c) = ans_rule(10)
