# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the (alpha) decay of (,^226Ra), another isotope in the decay series of (,^238U), first recognized as a new element by the Curies. Poses special problems because its daughter is a radioactive noble gas. 
## Part 1 
<center>(^226_88Ra_138 ,, longrightarrow ,, ^a_bRn_c ,, + ,, ^4_2He_2)</center> 
## Part 2 
(a) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 3 
(b) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 4 
(c) = ans_rule(10)
