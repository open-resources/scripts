Click htmlLink( alias('Half_Lives_Appendix.png'), "here", "TARGET='_blank'" ) to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances. 
## Part 1 
A rare decay mode has been observed in which (,^222Ra) emits a (,^14C) nucleus. Identify the nuclide by first filling out the missing fields in the equation

## Part 3 
(a) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 4 
(b) = ans_rule(10) 
## Part 5 
(c) = ans_rule(10)
