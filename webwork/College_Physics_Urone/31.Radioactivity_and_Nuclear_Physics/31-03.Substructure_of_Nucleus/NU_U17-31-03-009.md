# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The detail observable using a probe is limited by its wavelength. Calculate the energy of a (gamma)-ray photon that has a wavelength of ($wavelength times 10^-16 , m), small enough to detect details about one-tenth the size of a nucleon. 
## Part 1 
Note that a photon having this energy is difficult to produce and interacts poorly with the nucleus, limiting the practicability of this probe.
