# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Devise a formula for nuclear density in terms of (u) (the atomic mass unit), (r)<sub>0</sub>, and other constants for a nucleus having mass (Au) and that obeys the relation ((r) = (r)<sub>0</sub>(A^1/3). 
## Part 1 
Enter "u" for (,u) and "R" for(,r)<sub>0</sub>:
