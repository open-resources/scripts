# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the radius of (,^58Ni), one of the most tightly bound stable nuclei. 
## Part 1 
What is the ratio of the radius of (,^58Ni) to that of (,^258Ha), one of the largest nuclei ever made? Note that the radius of the largest nucleus is still much smaller than the size of an atom.
