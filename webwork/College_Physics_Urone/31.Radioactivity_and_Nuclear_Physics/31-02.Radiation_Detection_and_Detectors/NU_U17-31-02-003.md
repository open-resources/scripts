# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A particle of ionizing radiation creates ($n) ion pairs in the gas inside a Geiger tube as it passes through. What minimum energy was deposited, if ($energy_per_pair , eV) is required to create such an ion par? 
## Part 1 
If all of this energy is converted to thermal energy in the gas, what is its temperature increase, assuming ($volume , cm^3) of ideal gas at ($pressure , atm) pressure in a ($temperatureSI , K) environment? (The small answer is consistent with the fact that the energy is large on a quantum mechanical scale but small on a macroscopic scale.)
