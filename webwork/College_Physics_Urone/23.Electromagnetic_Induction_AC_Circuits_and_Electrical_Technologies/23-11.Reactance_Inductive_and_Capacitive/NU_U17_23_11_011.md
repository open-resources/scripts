# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A certain type of capacitor is designed to filter high-frequency signals by shorting them to earth/ground. 
## Part 1 
What capacitance is needed to produce a reactance of ($reactance_a) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>m&Omega;</span> for a ($frequency_a) (kHz) signal? 
## Part 2 
What would its reactance be at ($frequency_bSI) (Hz)?
