# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An inductor designed to filter high-frequency noise from power supplied to a personal computer is placed in series with the computer. What minimum inductance should it have to produce a ($reactance_a) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> reactance for ($frequency_a) (kHz) noise? 
## Part 1 
What is its reactance at ($frequency_bSI) (Hz)?
