# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A certain type of capacitor is designed to filter low-frequency signals, impeding their transmission between circuits. 
## Part 1 
What capacitance is needed to produce a ($reactance_a) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> reactance at a frequency of ($frequency_aSI) (Hz)? 
## Part 2 
What would its reactance be at ($frequency_b) (MHz)?
