# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> In a recording of voltages due to brain activity (an EEG), a ($voltage) (mV) signal with a ($frequencySI) (Hz) frequency is applied to a capacitor, producing a current of ($current) (mA). Resistance is negligible. What is the capacitance?
