# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have a supply of inductors ranging from ($inductance_low) (nH) to ($inductance_highSI) (H), and resistors ranging from ($resistance_lowSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> to ($resistance_high) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;</span>. What is the range of characteristic RL time constants you can produce by connecting a single resistor to a single inductor?
