# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Use the exact exponential treatment to find how much time is required to bring the current through an ($inductance) (mH) inductor in series with a ($resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor to ($ratio)(%) of its final value, starting from zero.
