# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Your RL circuit has a characteristic time constant of ($taua) (ns), and a resistance of ($resistancea) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;</span>. 
## Part 1 
What is the inductance of the circuit? 
## Part 2 
What resistance would give you a ($taub) (ns) time constant, perhaps needed for quick response in an oscilloscope?
