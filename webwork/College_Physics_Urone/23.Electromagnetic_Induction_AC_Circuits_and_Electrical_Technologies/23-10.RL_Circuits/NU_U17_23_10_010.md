# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Using the exact exponential treatment, find the time required for the current through a ($inductanceSI) (H) inductor in series with a ($resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> resistor to be reduced to ($ratio)(%) of its original value.
