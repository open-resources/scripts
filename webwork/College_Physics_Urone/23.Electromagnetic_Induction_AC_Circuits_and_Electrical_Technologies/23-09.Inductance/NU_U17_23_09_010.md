# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The heating coils in a hair dryer are ($diameter) (cm) in diameter, have a combined length of ($lengthSI) (m), and a total of ($turns) turns. 
## Part 1 
What is their total self-inductance assuming they act like a single solenoid? 
## Part 2 
How much energy is stored in them when ($currentSI) (A) flows? 
## Part 3 
What average emf opposes shutting them off if this is done in ($time) (ms)?
