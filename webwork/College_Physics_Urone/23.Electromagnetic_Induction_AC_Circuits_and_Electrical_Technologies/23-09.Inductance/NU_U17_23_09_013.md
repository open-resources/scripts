# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A very large, superconducting solenoid such as one used in MRI scans, stores ($energy) (MJ) of energy in its magnetic field when ($currentSI) (A) flows. 
## Part 1 
Find its self-inductance. 
## Part 2 
If the coils “go normal,” they gain resistance and start to dissipate thermal energy. What temperature increase is produced if all the stored energy goes into heating the ($massSI) (kg) magnet, given its average specific heat is ($heatcapSI) (J/kg)(^circC)?
