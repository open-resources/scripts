# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Calculate the self-inductance of a ($length) (cm) long, ($diameter) (cm) diameter solenoid having ($loops) loops. 
## Part 1 
How much energy is stored in this inductor when ($currentSI) (A) of current flows through it? 
## Part 2 
How fast can it be turned off if the induced emf cannot exceed ($emfSI) (V)?
