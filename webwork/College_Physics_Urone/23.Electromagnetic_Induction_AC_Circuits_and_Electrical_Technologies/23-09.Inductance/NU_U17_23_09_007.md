# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A large research solenoid has a self-inductance of ($inductanceSI) (H). 
## Part 1 
What induced emf opposes shutting it off when ($currentSI) (A) of current through it is switched off in ($time) (ms)? 
## Part 2 
How much energy is stored in the inductor at full current? 
## Part 3 
At what rate in watts must energy be dissipated to switch the current off in ($time) (ms)?
