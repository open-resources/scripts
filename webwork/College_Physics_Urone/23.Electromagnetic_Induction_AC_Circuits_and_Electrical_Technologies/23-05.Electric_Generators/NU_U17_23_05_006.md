# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A bicycle generator with a ($turns)-turn coil is driven by a ($diameter) cm diameter wheel that rolls on the outside rim of the bicycle tire. 
## Part 1 
What is the velocity of the bicycle if the generator's angular velocity is ($omegaA) (rad/s)? 
## Part 2 
What is the maximum emf of the generator when the bicycle moves at ($speedSIB) (m/s), noting that it was ($emfSIA) (V) under the original conditions? 
## Part 3 
If the sophisticated generator can vary its own magnetic field, what field strength will it need at ($speedSIC) (m/s) to produce a ($emfSIC) (V) maximum emf if the area of the coil is ($areaC times 10^-4) (m^2)?
