# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
If the emf of a coil rotating in a magnetic field is zero at (t = 0) , and increases to its first peak at (t =) ($time) (ms): 
## Part 1 
What is the angular velocity of the coil? 
## Part 2 
At what time will its next maximum occur? 
## Part 3 
What is the period of the output? 
## Part 4
