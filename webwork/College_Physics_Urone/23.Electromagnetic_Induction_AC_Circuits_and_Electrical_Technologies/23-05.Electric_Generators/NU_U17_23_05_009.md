# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($turns)-turn, ($diameter) (cm) diameter coil rotates at an angular velocity of ($omega) (rad/s) in a ($strengthSI) (T) field, starting with the plane of the coil parallel to the field. 
## Part 1 
What is the peak emf? 
## Part 2 
At what time is the peak emf first reached? 
## Part 3 
At what time is the emf first at its most negative? 
## Part 4 
What is the period of the AC voltage output?
