# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A car generator turns at ($rpm) (rpm) when the engine is idling. Its ($turns)-turn, ($length) (cm) by ($width) (cm) rectangular coil rotates in an adjustable magnetic field so that it can produce sufficient voltage even at low rpms. What is the field strength needed to produce a ($emfSI) (V) peak emf?
