# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A large power plant generates electricity at ($generated_voltage) (kV). Its old transformer once converted the voltage to ($old_voltage) (kV). The secondary of this transformer is being replaced so that its output can be ($new_voltage) (kV) for more efficient cross-country transmission on upgraded transmission lines. 
## Part 1 
What is the ratio of turns in the new secondary compared with the old secondary? 
## Part 2 
What is the ratio of new current output to old output (at ($old_voltage) (kV)) for the same power? 
## Part 3 
If the upgraded transmission lines have the same resistance, what is the ratio of new line power loss to old?
