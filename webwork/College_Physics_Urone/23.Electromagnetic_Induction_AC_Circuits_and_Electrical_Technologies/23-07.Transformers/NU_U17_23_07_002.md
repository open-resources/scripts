# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An American traveler in New Zealand carries a transformer to convert New Zealand's standard ($input_voltageSI) (V) to ($output_voltageSI) (V) so that she can use some small appliances on her trip. 
## Part 1 
What is the ratio of turns in the primary and secondary coils of her transformer? 
## Part 2 
What is the ratio of input to output current?
