# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> The ($input_voltage) (kV) AC electricity from a power transmission line is fed into the primary coil of a transformer. The ratio of the number of turns in the secondary to the number in the primary is (fracN_sN_p = ($turnsratio). 
## Part 1 
What voltage is induced in the secondary?
