# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A plug-in transformer supplies ($output_voltageSI) (V) to a video game system. 
## Part 1 
How many turns are in its secondary coil, if its input voltage is ($input_voltageSI) (V) and the primary coil has ($input_turns) turns? 
## Part 2 
What is its input current when its output is ($output_currentSI) (A)?
