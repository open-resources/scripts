# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose you have a supply of inductors ranging from ($inductance_low) (nH) to ($inductance_highSI) (H), and capacitors ranging from ($capacitance_low) (pF) to ($capacitance_highSI) (F). What is the range of resonant frequencies that can be achieved from combinations of a single inductor and a single capacitor?
