# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
To receive AM radio, you want an RLC circuit that can be made to resonate at any frequency between ($frequency_low) (kHz) and ($frequency_high) (kHz). This is accomplished with a fixed ($inductance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;H</span> inductor connected to a variable capacitor. What range of capacitance is needed?
