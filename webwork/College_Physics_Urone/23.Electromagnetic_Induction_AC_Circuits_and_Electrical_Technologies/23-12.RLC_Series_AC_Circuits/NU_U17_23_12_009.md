# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The lowest frequency in the FM radio band is ($frequency_a) (MHz), 
## Part 1 
What inductance is needed to produce this resonant frequency if it is connected to a ($capacitance_a) (pF) capacitor? 
## Part 2 
The capacitor is variable, to allow the resonant frequency to be adjusted to as high as ($frequency_b) (MHz). What must the capacitance be at this frequency?
