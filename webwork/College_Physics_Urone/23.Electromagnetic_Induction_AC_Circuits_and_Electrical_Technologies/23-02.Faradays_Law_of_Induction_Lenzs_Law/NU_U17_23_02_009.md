# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A ($radiusSI) (m) radius, ($turns)-turn coil is rotated one-fourth of a revolution in ($time) (ms) (this is (60) (rev/s)) originally having its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. Find the magnetic field strength needed to induce an average emf of ($emfSI) (V).
