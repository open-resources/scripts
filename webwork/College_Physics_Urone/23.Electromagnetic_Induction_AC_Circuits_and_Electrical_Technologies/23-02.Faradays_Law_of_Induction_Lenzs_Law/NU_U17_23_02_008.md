# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An emf is induced by rotating a ($turns)-turn, ($diameter) (cm) diameter coil in the Earth's ($strength times 10^-5) (T) magnetic field. What average emf is induced, given the plane of the coil is originally perpendicular to the Earth's field and is rotated to be parallel to the field in ($time) (ms)?
