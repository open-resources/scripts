# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b>An MRI technician moves his hand from a region of very low magnetic field strength into an MRI scanner's ($strengthSI) (T) field with his fingers pointing in the direction of the field. 
## Part 1 
Find the average emf induced in his wedding ring, given its diameter is ($diameter) (cm) and assuming it takes ($timeSI) (s) to move it into the field. 
## Part 2 
What current is induced in the ring if its resistance is ($resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>? 
## Part 3 
What average power is dissipated? 
## Part 4 
What magnetic field is induced at the center of the ring?
