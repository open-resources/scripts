# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
Suppose a ($turns)-turn coil lies in the plane of the page in a uniform magnetic field that is directed into the page. The coil originally has an area of ($areaSI) (m^2). It is stretched to have no area in ($timeSI) (s). What is the magnitude of the induced emf if the uniform magnetic field has a strength of ($strengthSI) (T)?
