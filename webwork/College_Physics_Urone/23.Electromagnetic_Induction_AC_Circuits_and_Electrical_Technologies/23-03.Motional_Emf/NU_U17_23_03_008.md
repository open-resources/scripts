# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In the August 1992 space shuttle flight, only ($lengthSI) (m) of the conducting tether could be let out. A ($emfSI) (V) motional emf was generated in the Earth's ($strength times 10^-5) (T) field, while moving at ($speed times 10^3) (m/s). What was the angle between the shuttle's velocity and the Earth's field, assuming the conductor was perpendicular to the field?
