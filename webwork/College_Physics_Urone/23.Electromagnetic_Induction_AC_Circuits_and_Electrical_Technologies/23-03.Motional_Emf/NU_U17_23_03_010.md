# {{ params.vars.title }}![Tethered Satellite](NU_U17_23_03_010.png)

## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> The Tethered Satellite in the figure above has a mass of ($massSI) (kg) and is at the end of a ($length) (km) long, ($diameter) (mm) diameter steel cable. 
## Part 1 
How much does the cable stretch if a ($forceSI) (N) force is exerted to pull the satellite in? (Assume the satellite and shuttle are at the same altitude above the Earth.) 
## Part 2 
What is the effective force constant of the cable? 
## Part 3 
How much energy is stored in it when stretched by the ($forceSI) (N) force?
