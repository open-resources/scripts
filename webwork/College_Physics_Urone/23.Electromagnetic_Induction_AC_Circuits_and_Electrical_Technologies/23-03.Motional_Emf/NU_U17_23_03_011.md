# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A Tethered Satellite is ($length) (km) long, producing ($voltage) (kV), and a current of ($currentSI) (A) flows, in the Earth's ($strength times 10^-5) (T) field. 
## Part 1 
What magnetic drag force does this produce if the system is moving at ($speed) (km/s)? 
## Part 2 
How much kinetic energy is removed from the system in ($time) (h), neglecting any change in altitude or velocity during that time? 
## Part 3 
What is the change in velocity if the mass of the system is ($massSI) (kg)?
