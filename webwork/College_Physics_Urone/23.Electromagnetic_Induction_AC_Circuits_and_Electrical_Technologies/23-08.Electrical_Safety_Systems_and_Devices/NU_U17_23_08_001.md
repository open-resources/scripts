# {{ params.vars.title }}![Short Circuit Diagram](NU_U17_23_08_001.png)

## Part 0 
A short circuit to the grounded metal case of an appliance occurs and the person touching the case is wet and only has a ($resistance_person) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistance to earth/ground. 
## Part 1 
What is the voltage on the case if ($current_person) (mA) flows through the person? 
## Part 2 
What is the current in the short circuit if the resistance of the earth/ground wire is ($resistance_wireSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span>?
