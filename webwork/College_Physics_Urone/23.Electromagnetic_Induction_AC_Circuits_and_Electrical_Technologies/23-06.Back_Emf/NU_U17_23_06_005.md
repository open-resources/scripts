# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> The motor in a toy car is powered by four batteries in series, which produce a total emf of ($emfSI) (V). The motor draws ($current_runningSI) (A) and develops a ($backemfSI) (V) back emf at normal speed. Each battery has a ($internal_resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;</span> internal resistance. What is the resistance of the motor?
