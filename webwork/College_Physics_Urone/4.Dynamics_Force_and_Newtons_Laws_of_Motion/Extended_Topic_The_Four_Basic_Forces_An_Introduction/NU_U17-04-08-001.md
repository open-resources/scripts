# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
(a) What is the strength of the weak nuclear force relative to the strong nuclear force? 
## Part 2 
(b) What is the strength of the weak nuclear force relative to the electromagnetic force? Since the weak nuclear force acts at only very short distances, such as inside nuclei, where the strong and electromagnetic forces also act, it might seem surprising that we have any knowledge of it at all. We have such knowledge because the weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, a type of nuclear decay not explained by other forces.
