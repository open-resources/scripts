# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
(a) What net external force is exerted on a ($massSI , kg) artillery shell fired from a battleship if the shell is accelerated at ($v times 10^4 , m/s^2)? 
## Part 2 
(b) What force is exerted on the ship by the artillery shell, taking the direction in which the shell was fired to be positive?
