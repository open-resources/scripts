# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A brave but inadequate rugby player is being pushed backward by an opposing player who is exerting a force of ($force_internalSI , N) on him. The mass of the losing player plus equipment is ($mass_smallSI , kg), and he is accelerating at ($v , m/s^2) backward. 
## Part 2 
(a) What is the force of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? 
## Part 3 
(b) What force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his mass plus equipment is ($mass_largeSI , kg)?
