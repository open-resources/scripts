# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A basketball player jumps straight up for a ball. To do this, he lowers his body ($d , m) and then accelerates through this distance by forcefully straightening his legs. This player leaves the floor with a vertical velocity sufficient to carry him ($h , m) above the floor. 
## Part 2 
(a) Calculate his velocity when he leaves the floor. 
## Part 3 
(b) Calculate his acceleration while he is straightening his legs. He goes from zero to the velocity found in part (a) in a distance of ($d , m). 
## Part 4 
(c) Calculate the force he exerts on the floor to do this, given that his mass is ($m , kg).
