# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($m , kg) dolphin decelerates from (12.0 , m/s) to (7.50 , m/s) in ($t , s) to join another dolphin in play. What average force was exerted to slow him if he was moving horizontally? (The gravitational force is balanced by the buoyant force of the water.)
