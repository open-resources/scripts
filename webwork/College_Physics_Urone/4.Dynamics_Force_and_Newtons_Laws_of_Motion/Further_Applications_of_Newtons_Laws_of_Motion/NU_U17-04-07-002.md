# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Achilles Tendon](Figure_04_07_04.png)

## Part 0 
Two muscles in the back of the leg pull upward on the Achilles tendon, as shown above. (These muscles are called the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle.) Find the magnitude of the total force on the Achilles tendon.
