# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A flea jumps by exerting a force of  ($f times 10^-5 , N) straight down on the ground. A breeze blowing on the flea parallel to the ground exerts a force of ($b times 10^-6 , N) on the flea. Find the direction and magnitude of the acceleration of the flea if its mass is ($m times 10^-7 , kg). Do not neglect the gravitational force. 
## Part 2
