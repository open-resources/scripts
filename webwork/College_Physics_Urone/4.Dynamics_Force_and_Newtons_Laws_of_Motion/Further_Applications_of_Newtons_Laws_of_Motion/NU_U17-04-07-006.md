# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A large rocket has a mass of ($m times 10^6 , kg) at takeoff, and its engines produce a thrust of ($t times 10^7 , N).$PAR (a) Find its initial acceleration if it takes off vertically. 
## Part 2 
(b) How long does it take to reach a velocity of ($v , km/h) straight up, assuming constant mass and thrust?
