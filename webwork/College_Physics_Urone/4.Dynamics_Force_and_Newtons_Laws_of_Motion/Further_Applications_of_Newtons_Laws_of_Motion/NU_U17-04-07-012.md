# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A ($m , kg) man stands on a bathroom scale in an elevator that accelerates from rest to ($v , m/s) in ($t , s). Calculate the scale reading in newtons and compare it with his weight. (The scale exerts an upward force on him equal to its reading.)
