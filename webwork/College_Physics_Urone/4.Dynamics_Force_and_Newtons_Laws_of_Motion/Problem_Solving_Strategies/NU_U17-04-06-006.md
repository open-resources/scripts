# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Commercial airplanes are sometimes pushed out of the passenger loading area by a tractor. 
## Part 2 
(a) An (1800 , kg) tractor exerts a force of ($f times 10^4 , N) backward on the pavement, and the system experiences forces resisting motion that total (2400 , N). If the acceleration is ($a , m/s^2), what is the mass of the airplane? 
## Part 3 
(b) Calculate the force exerted by the tractor on the airplane, assuming (2200 , N) of the friction is experienced by the airplane.
