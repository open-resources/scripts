# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
The wheels of a midsize car exert a force of ($f , N) backward on the road to accelerate the car in the forward direction. If the force of friction including air resistance is ($r , N) and the acceleration of the car is ($a , m/s^2), what is the mass of the car plus its occupants?
