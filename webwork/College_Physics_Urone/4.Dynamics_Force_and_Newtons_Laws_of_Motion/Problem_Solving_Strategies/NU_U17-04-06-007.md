# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A ($m , kg) car pulls a boat on a trailer. 
## Part 2 
(a) What total force resists the motion of the car, boat, and trailer, if the car exerts a ($f , N) force on the road and produces an acceleration of ($v , m/s^2)? The mass of the boat plus trailer is ($b ,kg). 
## Part 3 
(b) What is the force in the hitch between the car and the trailer if (80%) of the resisting forces are experienced by the boat and trailer?
