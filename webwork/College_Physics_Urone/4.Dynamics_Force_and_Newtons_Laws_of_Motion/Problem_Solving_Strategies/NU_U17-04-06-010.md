## Part 0 
Suppose your car was mired deeply in the mud and you wanted to use the method illustrated above to pull it out. 
## Part 1 
(a) What force would you have to exert perpendicular to the center of the rope to produce a force of ($f  , N) on the car if the angle is(:2.00^circ)? 
## Part 2 
(b) Real ropes stretch under such forces. What force would be exerted on the car if the angle increases to(:7.00^circ) and you still apply the force found in part (a) to its centre?
