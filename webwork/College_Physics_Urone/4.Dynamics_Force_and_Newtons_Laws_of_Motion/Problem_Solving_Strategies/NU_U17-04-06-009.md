# {{ params.vars.title }}![Forces on Sled](Figure_04_06_05.png)

## Part 0 
Two children pull a third child on a snow saucer sled exerting forces  and  as shown above. Find the acceleration of the ($m , kg) sled-and-child system. Note that the direction of the frictional force is unspecified; it will be in the opposite direction of the sum of  (F_1) and (F_2).
