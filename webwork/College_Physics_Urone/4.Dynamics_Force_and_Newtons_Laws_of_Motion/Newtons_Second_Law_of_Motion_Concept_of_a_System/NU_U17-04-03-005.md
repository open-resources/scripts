## Part 0 
The net external force on the ($m , kg) mower is stated to be ($f , N). 
## Part 1 
(a) If the force of friction opposing the motion is ($d , N), what force  (in newtons) is the person exerting on the mower? 
## Part 2 
(b) Suppose the mower is moving at ($v , m/s) when the force  is removed. How far will the mower go before stopping?
