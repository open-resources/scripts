## Part 0 
A rocket sled accelerates at a rate of ($accelerationSI , (m/s^2). Its passenger has a mass of ($massSI , (kg). 
## Part 1 
(a) Calculate the horizontal component of the force the seat exerts against his body. 
## Part 2 
(b) Calculate the magnitude of the total force the seat exerts against his body. 
## Part 3 
(c) The total force acts at how many degrees above the positive (x - ) axis?
