# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Suppose two children push horizontally, but in exactly opposite directions, on a third child in a wagon. The first child exerts a force of (75.0 , (N), the second a force of (90.0 , N), friction is ($d1 , N), and the mass of the third child plus wagon is ($w , kg). 
## Part 2 
(a) Calculate the acceleration. 
## Part 3 
(b) What would the acceleration be if friction were (15.0 , N)?
