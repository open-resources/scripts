# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war. Each of the first team's members has an average mass of ($t1 , kg) and exerts an average force of ($f1 , N) horizontally. Each of the second team's members has an average mass of ($t2 , kg) and exerts an average force of ($f2 , N) horizontally. 
## Part 2 
(a) What is the acceleration of the two teams? 
## Part 3 
(b) What is the tension in the section of rope between the teams?
