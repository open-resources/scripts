# {{ params.vars.title }}![Baby Weighed with Spring Scale](Figure_04_05_14.png)

## Part 0 
Consider the baby being weighed. 
## Part 1 
(a) What is the mass of the child and basket if a scale reading of ($f , N) is observed? 
## Part 2 
(b) What is the tension in the cord attaching the baby to the scale? 
## Part 3 
(c) What is the tension  in the cord attaching the scale to the ceiling, if the scale has a mass of ($m , kg)?
