# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A prankster applies ($voltageSI) (V) to an ($capacitance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; Font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor and then tosses it to an unsuspecting victim. The victim's finger is burned by the discharge of the capacitor through ($mass) (g) of flesh. What is the temperature increase of the flesh?
