# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
A nervous physicist worries that the two metal shelves of his wood frame bookcase might obtain a high voltage if charged by static electricity, perhaps produced by friction. 
## Part 1 
What is the capacitance of the empty shelves if they have area ($areaSI) (m^2) and are ($distanceSI) (m) apart? 
## Part 2 
What is the voltage between them if opposite charges of magnitude ($charge) (nC) are placed on them? 
## Part 3 
To show that this voltage poses a small hazard, calculate the energy stored.
