# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In open heart surgery, a relatively small amount of energy will defibrillate the heart. 
## Part 1 
What voltage is applied to the ($capacitance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor of a heart defibrillator that stores ($energySI) (J) of energy? 
## Part 2 
Find the amount of stored charge.
