# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
In one of the classic nuclear physics experiments at the beginning of the 20th century, an alpha particle was accelerated toward a gold nucleus, and its path was substantially deflected by the Coulomb interaction. If the energy of the doubly charged alpha nucleus was ($KEMeV) (MeV), how close to the gold nucleus could it come before being deflected? (For reference, the size of a gold nucleus is about (7) (fm).)
