# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An electrostatic paint sprayer has a ($diameterSI)-(m)-diameter metal sphere at a potential of ($voltage) (kV) that repels paint droplets onto a grounded object. 
## Part 1 
What charge is on the sphere? 
## Part 2 
What charge must a ($mass)-(mg) drop of paint have to arrive at the object with a speed of ($velocitySI) (m/s)?
