# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> A(n) ($capacitor1) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span> capacitor is connected in parallel to another capacitor, producing a total capacitance of ($capequivalent) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F</span>. 
## Part 1 
What is the capacitance of the second capacitor?
