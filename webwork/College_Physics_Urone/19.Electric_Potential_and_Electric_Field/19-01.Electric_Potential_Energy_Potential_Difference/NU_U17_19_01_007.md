# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 1 
A lightning bolt strikes a tree, moving ($charge) (C) of charge through a potential difference of ($voltage times 10^2) (MV). 
## Part 2 
What energy was dissipated? 
## Part 3 
What mass of water could be raised from ($temp1^circC) to the boiling point and then boiled by this energy?
