# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($voltage) (V) battery-operated bottle warmer heats ($massglass) (g) of glass, ($masswater times 10^2) (g) of baby formula, and ($massalu times 10^2) (g) of aluminum from ($temp1^circC) to ($temp2^circC). Assume the baby forumula has the same thermal properties as water. 
## Part 1 
How much charge is moved by the battery? 
## Part 2 
How many electrons per second flow if it takes ($timemin) (min) to warm the formula?
