# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A battery-operated car utilizes a ($voltage) (V) system. Find the charge the batteries must be able to move in order to accelerate the ($mass) (kg) car from rest to ($velocityacc) (m/s), make it climb a ($height) (times 10^2) (m) high hill, and then cause it to travel at a constant ($velocityconst) (m/s) by exerting a ($force times 10^2) (N) force for an hour.
