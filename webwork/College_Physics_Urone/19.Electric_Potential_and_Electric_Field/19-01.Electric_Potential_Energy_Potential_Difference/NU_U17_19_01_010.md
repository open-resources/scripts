# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> Fusion probability is greatly enhanced when appropriate nuclei are brought close together, but mutual Coulomb repulsion must be overcome. This can be done using the kinetic energy of high-temperature gas ions or by accelerating the nuclei toward one another. 
## Part 1 
Calculate the potential energy of two singly charged nuclei separated by ($distance times 10^-12) (m). 
## Part 2 
At what temperature will atoms of a gas have an average kinetic energy equal to this needed electrical potential energy?
