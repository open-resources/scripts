# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
An electron is to be accelerated in a uniform electric field having a strength of ($EField times 10^6) (V/m). 
## Part 1 
What energy in (keV) is given to the electron if it is accelerated through ($distanceASI) (m)? 
## Part 2 
Over what distance would it have to be accelerated to increase its energy by ($energyBGeV) (GeV)?
