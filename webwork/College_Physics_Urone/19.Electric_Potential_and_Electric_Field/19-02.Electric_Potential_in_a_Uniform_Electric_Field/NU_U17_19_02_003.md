# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
The electric field strength between two parallel conducting plates separated by ($distanceT) (cm) is ($EField) (times 10^4) (V/m). 
## Part 1 
What is the potential difference between the plates? 
## Part 2 
The plate with the lowest potential is taken to be at zero volts. What is the potential ($distanceb) (cm) from that plate?
