# {{ params.vars.title }}## Part 0 
<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>. 
## Part 1 
Two parallel conducting plates are separated by ($distanceT) (cm), and one of them is taken to be at zero volts. 
## Part 2 
What is the electric field strength between them, if the potential ($distancezero) (cm) from the zero volt plate (and ($distancehigh) (cm) from the other) is ($voltageSI) (V)? 
## Part 3 
What is the voltage between the plates?
