## Question Section 

A woodpecker's brain is specially protected from large decelerations by tendon-like attachments inside the skull. While pecking on a tree, the woodpecker's head comes to a stop from an initial velocity of(v,(ms) in a distance of only(d1,(mm).
a) Find the acceleration in multiples of(9.8,(ms^2) ((g)).
b) Calculate the stopping time.
c) The tendons cradling the brain stretch, making its stopping distance(d2,(mm) (greater than the head and, hence, less deceleration of the brain). What is the brain's deceleration, expressed in multiples of(g) ?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(0.55,0.65,0.001)
d1 = randrange(1.7,2.3,0.01)
d2 = randrange(4.2,4.7,0.01)

A1 = (v)**2/(0.0196*d1)
A2 = v/(A1*9.8)
A3 = (v)**2/(0.0196*d2)
