## Question Section 

A dragster can reach a top speed of(V,(ms) in only(T,(s).
a) Calculate the average acceleration for such a dragster.
b) Find the final velocity of this dragster starting from rest and accelerating at the rate found in (a) for(402,(m) (a quarter mile) without using any information on time. Assume a constant acceleration. Note this is not valid for a dragster, which would reach a terminal speed in actuality.
 

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
V = randrange(140,150,1)
T = randrange(4.41,4.49,0.01)

a = V/T
v = sqrt(V**2+2*a*402)
