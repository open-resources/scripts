## Question Section 

Blood is accelerated from rest to(speed,(cms) in a distance of(distance,(cm) by the left ventricle of the heart. How long does the acceleration take?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(20,40,0.1)
distance = randrange(1.5,2,0.01)
A1 = (2)*(distance)/((0)+(speed))
