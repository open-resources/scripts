## Question Section 

a) A light-rail commuter train accelerates at a rate of(acceleration,(ms^2). How long does it take to reach its top speed of(speed,(kmh), starting from rest?
b) The same train ordinarily decelerates at a rate of(deceleration,(ms^2). How long does it take to come to a stop from its top speed?
c) In emergencies the train can decelerate more rapidly, coming to rest from(speedkmh) in(time s). What is its emergency deceleration?
(-)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
acceleration = randrange(1,2,0.01)
deceleration = randrange(1,2,0.01)
speed = randrange(70,90,0.1)
time = randrange(6,9,0.01)

A1 = (speed)*(1000)/((3600)*(acceleration)) 
A2 = (speed)*(1000)/((3600)*(deceleration)) 
A3 = (speed)*(1000)/((3600)*(time))
