## Question Section 

While entering a freeway, a car accelerates from rest at a rate of(acceleration,(ms^2) for(time,(s). To help with this question, draw a sketch of the situation and list the knowns in this problem. 
a) How far does the car travel in those(time,(s)?
b) What is the car's final velocity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(10,14,0.1)
acceleration = randrange(2,3,0.01)

A1 = (0.5)*(acceleration)*(time)**(2)
A2 = (time)*(acceleration)
