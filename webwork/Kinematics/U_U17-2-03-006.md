## Question Section 

Tidal friction is slowing the rotation of the Earth. As a result, the orbit of the Moon is increasing in radius at a rate of approximately(4,cmyear). Assuming this to be a constant rate, how many years will pass before the radius of the Moon's orbit increases by(3.84times 10^6,m) (which is(1%) of its current value)?

## Answer Section

A1 = 96000000
