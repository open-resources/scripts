## Question Section 

The North American and European continents are moving apart at a rate of about(rate)(cmyear). At this rate how long will it take them to drift(distance,km) farther apart than they are at present?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
rate = 3
distance = randrange(400,600,1)

A1 = (distance)*(1000)*(100)/(rate)
