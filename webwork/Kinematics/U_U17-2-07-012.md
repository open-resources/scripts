## Question Section 

An object is dropped from a height of(d,(m) above ground level.
a) Determine the distance traveled during the first second.
b) Determine the final velocity at which the object hits the ground.
c) Determine the distance traveled during the last second of motion before hitting the ground.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(50,100,0.1)

A1 = 4.9
A2 = sqrt((2)*(9.8)*(d))
A3 = (d)-(1/2)*(9.8)*(((sqrt((2)*(d)/(9.8)))-1)**(2))
