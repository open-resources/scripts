## Question Section 

Standing at the base of one of the cliffs of Mt. Arapiles in Victoria, Australia, a hiker hears a rock break loose from a height of(105,(m). He can't see the rock right away but then does,(t,(s) later.
a) How far above the hiker is the rock when he can see it?
b) How much time does he have to move before the rock hits his head?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(1,2,0.01)

A1 = 105-((1/2)*(9.8)*((t)**(2)))
A2 = sqrt((2)*(105)/(9.8))-t
