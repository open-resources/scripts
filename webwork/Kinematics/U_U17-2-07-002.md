## Question Section 

Calculate the displacement and velocity at time(t,(s) for a rock thrown straight down with an initial speed of(v,(ms) from the Verrazano Narrows Bridge in New York City. The roadway of this bridge is(70.0,(m) above the water. Take upwards to be the positive direction.
Displacement =
Velocity =

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(0.3,2,0.01)
v = randrange(10,17,0.1)
A1 = (-v)*(t)+(0.5)*(-9.8)*((t)**(2))
A2 = (-v)+(-9.8)*(t)
