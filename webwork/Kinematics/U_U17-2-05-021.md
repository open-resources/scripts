## Question Section 

a) A world record was set for the men's(100,(m) dash in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing by Usain Bolt of Jamaica. Bolt “coasted” across the finish line with a time of(9.69,(s). If we assume that Bolt accelerated for(3.00,(s) to reach his maximum speed, and maintained that speed for the rest of the race, calculate his maximum speed and his acceleration.
b) During the same Olympics, Bolt also set the world record in the(200,(m) dash with a time of(19.30,(s). Using the same assumptions as for the(100,(m) dash (that is, it took him(3.00,(s) to reach maximum speed), what was his maximum speed for this race?

## Answer Section

A1 = 100/(6.69+1.5)
A2 = 12.2/3
A3 = 200/(16.3+1.5)
