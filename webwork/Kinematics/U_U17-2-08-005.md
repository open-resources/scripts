(a) The subway train moves to the right from( x_0) to( x_f). Its displacement,(Delta x), is(+2.0,km). (b) The train moves to the left from(x'_0) to(x'_f). Its displacement(Delta x') is( -1.5,km).
The train accelerates from rest to(30.0,kmh). After, it slows to a stop in( 30.0kmh).
Construct the displacement graph for the subway shuttle train as shown in the above figure.
