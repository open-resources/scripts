## Question Section 

You throw a ball straight up with an initial velocity of(15.0,(ms). It passes a tree branch on the way up at a height of(7.00,(m). How much additional time will pass before the ball passes the tree branch on the way back down?

## Answer Section

a = 9.37016542
A1 = -(15-a)/9.8+(15+a)/9.8
