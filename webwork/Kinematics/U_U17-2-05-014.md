## Question Section 

An unwary football player collides with a padded goalpost while running at a velocity of(v,(ms) and comes to a full stop after compressing the padding and his body(d,(m).
a) What is his deceleration?
b) How long does the collision last?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(6,8,0.01)
d = randrange(0.3,0.4,0.01)
A1 = -((v)**(2))/((2)*(d))
A2 = (2)*(d)/(v)
