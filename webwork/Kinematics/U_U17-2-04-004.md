## Question Text

Assume that an intercontinental ballistic missile goes from rest to a suborbital speed of(speed,kms) in(time,s) (the actual speed and time are classified). What is its average acceleration in(ms^2) and in multiples of(g)?
from random import randrange
speed = randrange(5,8,0.01)
time = randrange(50,70,0.1)

A1 = (speed)*(1000)/(time)
A2 = (A1)/(9.8)
