## Question Text

A ball is thrown straight up. It passes a(h,(m) high window(b,(m) off the ground on its path up and takes(t,(s) to traverse the window. What was the ball's initial velocity?
from random import randrange
b = randrange(7.25,7.75,0.01)
h = randrange(1.7,2.3,0.1)
t = randrange(0.97,1.3,0.01)
v = (h+4.9*(t)**2)/(t)
A1 = sqrt((v)**2+19.6*b)
