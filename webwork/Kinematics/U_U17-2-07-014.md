## Question Section 

A ball is thrown straight up. It passes a(h,(m) high window(b,(m) off the ground on its path up and takes(t,(s) to traverse the window. What was the ball's initial velocity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
b = randrange(7.25,7.75,0.01)
h = randrange(1.7,2.3,0.1)
t = randrange(0.97,1.3,0.01)
v = (h+4.9*(t)**2)/(t)
A1 = sqrt((v)**2+19.6*b)
