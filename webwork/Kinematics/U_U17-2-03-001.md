## Question Section 

a) Calculate Earth's average speed relative to the Sun, assuming the distance between the two is(1.50times 10^11,m). Also assume that there are(365.25) days in a year.
b) What is Earth's average velocity relative to the Sun over a period of one year?

## Answer Section

D = 2*pi*1.5*10**(11)
T = 365.25*24*3600
A1 = D/T
A2 = 0
