## Question Text

A bicycle racer sprints at the end of a race to clinch a victory. The racer has an initial velocity of(v,(ms) and accelerates at the rate of(a,(ms^2)  for(t,(s).  What is his final velocity? 
from random import randrange
a = randrange(0.3,0.8,0.01)
t = randrange(5,9,0.1)
v = randrange(10,13,0.1)
A1 = (v)+((a)*(t))
