## Question Section 

Consider a grey squirrel falling out of a tree to the ground.
a) If we ignore air resistance in this case (only for the sake of this problem), determine a squirrel's velocity just before hitting the ground, assuming it fell from a height of(a,(m).
ans_rule(40) 
b) If the squirrel stops in a distance of(b,(cm) through bending its limbs, what is its deceleration?
ans_rule(40)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(2,4,0.1)
b = randrange(1,4,0.1)
A1 = sqrt((2)*(9.8)*(a))
A2 = ((A1)**(2))/((2)*(b/100))
