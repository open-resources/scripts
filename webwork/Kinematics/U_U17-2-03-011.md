## Question Section 

The planetary model of the atom pictures electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus much as planets orbit the Sun. In this model you can view hydrogen, the simplest atom, as having a single electron in a circular orbit(distancetimes 10^-10)(m) in diameter. (a) If the average speed of the electron in this orbit is known to be(speedtimes 10^6)(ms), calculate the number of revolutions per second it makes about the nucleus. (b) What is the electron's average velocity over five complete revolutions?
a)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(2,3,0.01)
distance = randrange(1,1.2,0.01)

A1 = ((speed)*(10**(6)))/((1)*(pi)*((distance)*(10)**(-10)))
A2 = 0
