## Question Text

At the end of a race, a runner decelerates from a velocity of(speed,(ms) at a rate of(ratems^2).
a) How far does she travel in the next(time,(s)?
 
b) What is her final velocity? 
 
from random import randrange
speed = randrange(8,10,0.01)
rate = randrange(1.5,2.5,0.01)
time = randrange(4,6,0.01)

A1 = (speed)*(time)+(1/2)*(-rate)*(time)**(2)
A2 = (speed)-(rate)*(time)
