## Question Section 

A student drove to the university from her home and noted that the odometer reading of her car increased by(odometer,km). The trip took(time,min).
a) What was her average speed?
b) If the straight-line distance from her home to the university is(distance,km) in a direction(angle^circ) south of east, what was her average velocity in this direction? 
c) If she arrived home by the same path(7)(h)(30)(min) after she left, what were her average speed and velocity for the entire trip?
Average Speed = 
Average Velocity =

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
odometer = randrange(10,15,0.1)
time = randrange(15,20,0.1)
distance = randrange(8,12,0.1)
angle = randrange(20,30,0.1)

A1 = (odometer)*(60)/(time)
A2 = (distance)*(60)/(time)
A3 = (2)*(odometer)/(7.5)
A4 = 0
