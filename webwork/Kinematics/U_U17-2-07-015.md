## Question Section 

Suppose you drop a rock into a dark well and, using precision equipment, you measure the time for the sound of a splash to return. Neglecting the time required for sound to travel up the well, calculate the distance to the water if the sound returns in(t,(s).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(1.5,2.5,0.001)

A1 = (1/2)*(9.8)*((t)**(2))
