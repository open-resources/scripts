## Question Text

A dolphin in an aquatic show jumps straight up out of the water at a velocity of(v,(ms).  
a)  How high does his body rise above the water?
b) How long is the dolphin in the air? Neglect any effects due to his size or orientation.
from random import randrange
v = randrange(8,15,0.1)

A1 = ((v)**(2))/((2)*(9.8))
A2 = 2*(v)/(9.8)
