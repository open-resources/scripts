## Question Section 

A dolphin in an aquatic show jumps straight up out of the water at a velocity of(v,(ms).  
a)  How high does his body rise above the water?
b) How long is the dolphin in the air? Neglect any effects due to his size or orientation.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(8,15,0.1)

A1 = ((v)**(2))/((2)*(9.8))
A2 = 2*(v)/(9.8)
