## Question Section 

Freight trains can produce only relatively small accelerations and decelerations.
a) What is the final velocity of a freight train that accelerates at a rate of(accel,(ms^2) for(time,(min), starting with an initial velocity of(velocity,(ms)?  
b)  If the train can slow down at a rate of(accel2,(ms^2), how long will it take to come to a stop from this velocity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
accel = randrange(0.04,0.05,0.0001)
accel2 = randrange(0.05,0.06,0.001)
time = randrange(5,9,1)
velocity = randrange(3,5,0.01)
A1 = (velocity)+(accel)*(time)*(60)
A2 = (A1)/(accel2)
