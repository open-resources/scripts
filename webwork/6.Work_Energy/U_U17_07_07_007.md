## Question Section 

a) What is the average useful power output of a person who does(Watimes 10^6,J) of useful work in(hour,h)? 
b) Working at this rate, how long will it take this person to lift(m,kg) of bricks(h,m) to a platform? (Work done to lift his body can be omitted because it is not considered useful output here.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Wa = randrange(2.00,7.00,0.13)
WaJ = Wa*(10**6)
hour = randrange(5,9,1)
t = hour*3600
P = WaJ/t
m = randrange(2000,3000,13)
h = randrange(1.5,4.99,0.02)
g = 9.80
tb = (m*g*h)/P
