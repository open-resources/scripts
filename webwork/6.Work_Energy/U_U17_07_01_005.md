## Question Section 

Calculate the work done by a(m,kg) man who pushes a crate(d,m) up along a ramp that makes an angle of(degree^circ) with the horizontal. He exerts a force of(F,N) on the crate parallel to the ramp and moves at a constant speed. 
Be certain to include the work he does on the crate and on his body to get up the ramp.
## C
with the horizontal. He exerts a force of(F,N) on the crate parallel to the ramp and moves at a constant speed. 
### Answer Section
## G
man who pushes a crate(d,m) up along a ramp that makes an angle of(degree^circ) with the horizontal. He exerts a force of(F,N) on the crate parallel to the ramp and moves at a constant speed.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(65,99,3)
d = randrange(2,7,1)
degree = randrange(20,45,1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
F = randrange(402,609,13)
g = 9.80
W = d*(m*g*sin(rads)+F)
