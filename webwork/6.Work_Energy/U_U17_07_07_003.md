## Question Section 

A person in good physical condition can deliver(Po,W) of useful power for several hours at a stretch, perhaps by pedalling a mechanism that drives an electric generator. Neglect any losses due to generator inefficiency and practical considerations such as resting time. 
a) How many people would it take to run a(PakW,-kW) electric clothes dryer?
ans_rule(40) people
b) How many people would it take to replace a large electric power plant that generates(PbMW,MW)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

PakW = randrange(2.0,6.0,0.29)
Pa = PakW*(10**3)
PbMW = randrange(600,900,24)
Pb = PbMW*(10**6)
Po = randrange(100,200,27)
PaPo = Pa/Po
PbPo = Pb/Po
