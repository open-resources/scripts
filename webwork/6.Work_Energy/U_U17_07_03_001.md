## Question Section 

A hydroelectric power facility converts the gravitational potential energy of water behind a dam to electric energy. 
a) What is the gravitational potential energy relative to the generators of a lake of volume(50.0,km^3) (mass(5.00times 10^13,kg)), given that the lake has an average height of(h,m) above the generators? 
 
b) Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy stored in a 9-megaton fusion bomb ((3.8times 10^16,J)).

## A
What is the gravitational potential energy relative to the generators of a lake of volume(50.0,km^3) (mass(5.00times 10^13,kg)), given that the lake has an average height of(h,m) above the generators? 
### Answer Section
## B
Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy stored in a 9-megaton fusion bomb ((3.8times 10^16,J)).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = 5*(10**13)
g = 9.80
h = randrange(35,55,2)
PE = m*g*h
Eb = 3.8*(10**16)
Elb = PE/Eb
