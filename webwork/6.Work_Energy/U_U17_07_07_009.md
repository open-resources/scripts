## Question Section 

a) How long will it take a(m-kg) car with a useful power output of(P,hp) ((1,hp = 746,W)) to reach a speed of(v,ms), neglecting friction? 
b) How long will this acceleration take if the car also climbs a(h-m)-high hill in the process?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(500,700,23)
v = randrange(10,20,1)
v2 = v**2
h = randrange(3,9,1)
P = randrange(20,50,2)
PW = P*746
g = 9.8
ta = (0.5*m*v2)/PW
tb = ((0.5*m*v2)+(m*h*g))/PW
