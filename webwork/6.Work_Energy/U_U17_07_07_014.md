## Question Section 

a) Calculate the power per square meter reaching Earth's upper atmosphere from the Sun. (Take the power output of the Sun to be(4.00times 10^26,W) and the distance from the Sun to the Earth is(1.5times10^11,m)).
Part of this is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere, so that a maximum of(1.30,kWm^2) reaches Earth's surface. Calculate the area of solar energy collectors needed to replace an electric power plant that generates(750,MW) if the collectors convert an average of(2.00,%) of the maximum power into electricity. (This small conversion efficiency is due to the devices themselves, and the fact that the sun is directly overhead only briefly.) 
b) With the same assumptions, what area would be needed to meet the United States' energy needs(1.05times 10^20,Jy)? 
c) Australia's energy needs(5.4times 10^26,Jy)? 
d) China's energy needs(6.3times 10^26,Jy)?

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Wa = 4*(10**26)
Aa = 4*pi*((1.5*(10**11))**2)
PA = Wa/Aa
Pb = 7.5*(10**8)
Pc = 1.05*10**20/(365*24*60*60)
Pd = 5.4*10**18/(365*24*60*60)
Pe = 6.3*10**19/(365*24*60*60)
PAEff = (1.3*(10**3))*0.0200
Ab = Pb/PAEff
Ac = Pc/PAEff
Ad = Pd/PAEff
Ae = Pe/PAEff
