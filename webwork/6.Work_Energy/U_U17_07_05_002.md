## Question Section 

a) How high a hill can a car coast up (engine disengaged) if work done by friction is
negligible and its initial speed is(vokmh,kmh)? 
b) If, in actuality, a(m,kg) car with an initial speed of(vokmh,kmh) is observed to coast up a hill to a height(h,m) above its starting point, how much thermal energy was generated by friction? 
c) What is the average force of friction if the hill has a slope(degree ^circ) above the horizontal?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(755,975,26)
degree = randrange(1.4,4.5,0.1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
u = 0.0800
vokmh = randrange(113,219,23)
vo = vokmh*(1000/3600)
vo2 = vo**2
h = randrange(23.5,47,4.3)
g = 9.80
ha = vo2/(2*g)
Ef = m*((vo2/2)-g*h)
F = (Ef*sin(rads))/h
