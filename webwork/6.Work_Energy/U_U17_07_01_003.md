## Question Section 

a) Calculate the work done on a(m,(kg) elevator compartment by its cable to lift it(h,(m) at constant speed, assuming friction averages(F,(N). 
b) What is the work done on the elevator compartment by the gravitational force in this process? 
c) What is the total work done on the elevator compartment?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(1251,5499.99,72)
h = randrange(31.14,79.99,2.3)
g = 9.80
F = randrange(102,298,3)
Wc = (m*g+F)*h
Wg = -m*h*g
Wt = 0
