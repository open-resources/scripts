## Question Section 

If the energy in fusion bombs were used to supply the energy needs of the world, how many of the 9-megaton variety would be needed for a year's supply of energy, given that annual world energy use is(4times 10^20,J) and that a 9-megaton fusion bomb releases(3.8times 10^16,J)? This is not as far-fetched as it may soundâ€”there are thousands of nuclear bombs, and their energy can be trapped in underground explosions and converted to electricity, as natural geothermal energy is.
ans_rule(40) bombs


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Ewe = 4*(10**20)
Eb = 3.8*(10**16)
n = Ewe/Eb
