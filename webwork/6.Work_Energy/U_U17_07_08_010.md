## Question Section 

Jogging on hard surfaces with insufficiently padded shoes produces large forces in the feet and legs. 
a) Calculate the force needed to stop the downward motion of a jogger's leg, if his leg has a mass of(ml,kg), a speed of(v,ms), and stops in a distance of(dcm,cm). (Be certain to include the weight of the(mj-kg) jogger's body.)
b) Determine the ratio of this force to the weight of the jogger.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHints = 3

mj = randrange(75,99,3)
ml = randrange(12,19,1)
v = randrange(6,9,1)
v2 = v**2
dcm = randrange(1.30,3.75,0.05)
d = dcm/100
g = 9.8
Fleg = (ml*v2)/(2*d)
Fj = mj*g
Fnet = Fleg+Fj
Force = Fnet/Fj
