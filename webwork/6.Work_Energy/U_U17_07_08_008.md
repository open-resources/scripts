## Question Section 

Shoveling snow can be extremely taxing because the arms have such a low efficiency in this activity (3%). Suppose a person shoveling a footpath metabolizes food at the rate of(Pin,W). 
a) What is her useful power output? 
b) How long will it take her to lift(m,kg) of snow(h,m)? (This could be the amount of heavy snow on(20,m) of footpath.) 
c) How much waste heat transfer will she dissipate in the process?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Eff = 0.03
Pin = randrange(700,900,28)
Pouta = Eff*Pin
m = randrange(2392,3924,194)
h = randrange(1.23,3.45,0.14)
g = 9.8
t = (m*g*h)/Pouta
Ewaste = (Pin-Pouta)*t
