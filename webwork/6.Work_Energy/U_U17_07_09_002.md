## Question Section 

Integrated Concepts: A(m-kg) cross-country skier is climbing a(degree^circ) slope at a constant speed of(vo,ms) and encounters air resistance of(f,N). 
a) Find his power output for work done against the gravitational force and air resistance. 
b) What average force does he exert backward on the snow to accomplish this? 
c) If he continues to exert this force and to experience the same air resistance when he reaches a level area, how long will it take him to reach a velocity of(v,ms)?
## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(75,99,2)
degree = randrange(2,4,1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
vo = randrange(2,5,1)
v = randrange(10,13,1)
v2 = v**2
f = randrange(25,35,1)
g = 9.80
P = vo*(f+m*g*sin(rads))
Fb = f+m*g*sin(rads)
Fnet = (Fb-f)/m
t = (v-vo)/Fnet
