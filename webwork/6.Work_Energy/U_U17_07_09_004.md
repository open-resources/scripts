## Question Section 

A toy gun uses a spring with a force constant of(k,Nm) to propel a(mg-g) steel ball. If the spring is compressed(xcm,cm) and friction is negligible:
a) How much force is needed to compress the spring? 
b) To what maximum height can the ball be shot? 
c) At what angles above the horizontal may a child aim to hit a target(R,m) away at the same height as the gun? 
smaller angle =
larger angle =
d) What is the gun's maximum range on level ground?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

do {
mg = randrange(10,19,1)
m = mg/1000
k = randrange(111,214,2)
xcm = randrange(6,9,1)
x = xcm/100
x2 = x**2
g = 9.80
F = k*x
hf = (k*x2)/(2*m*g)
R = randrange(5,14,1)
} until (abs((R*g*m)/(k*x2)) < 1)
theta = 1/2*asin((R*g*m)/(k*x2))
degree = theta*(180/pi)
degree2 = 90 - theta*(180/pi)
Rmax = (k*x2)/(m*g)
