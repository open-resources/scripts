## Question Section 

Unreasonable Results.  Body fat is metabolized, supplying(kJg,kJg), when dietary intake is less than needed to fuel metabolism. The manufacturers of an exercise bicycle claim that you can lose(mkg,kg) of fat per day by vigorously exercising for(hour,h) per day on their machine. 
a) How many(kJ) are supplied by the metabolization of(mkg,kg) of fat?
b) Calculate the(kJmin) that you would have to utilize to metabolize fat at the rate of(mkg,kg) in(hour,h).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mkg = randrange(.500,.999,0.03)
m = mkg*1000
kJg = randrange(35,40,0.5)
hour = randrange(2,4,1)
min = hour*60
kJ = m*kJg
kJmin = kJ/min
