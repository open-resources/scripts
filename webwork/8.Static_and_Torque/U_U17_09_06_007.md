## Question Section 

<b>
Even when the head is held erect, as in the figure above, its centre of mass is not directly
over the principal point of support (the atlanto-occipital joint). The muscles at the
back of the neck should therefore exert a force to keep the head erect. That is why
your head falls forward when you fall asleep in the class.
a) Calculate the force exerted by these muscles using the information in the figure.
 
ans_rule(40)(N) downward

w = 50
Fm = w*(0.025/0.05)
Fj = Fm+w
