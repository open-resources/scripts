## Question Section 

<b>
Two children push on opposite sides of a door during play. Both push horizontally and
perpendicular to the door. One child pushes with a force of(F)(N) at a distance of
(r1)(m) from the hinges, and the second child pushes at a distance of(r2)(m). What force must the second child exert to keep the door from moving? Assume friction is negligible.
ans_rule(40)(N)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r1 = randrange(0.58,0.659,0.001)
r2 = randrange(0.408,0.500,0.001)
F = randrange(16.5,17.90,0.01)
torque = (r1*F)/r2
