## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you needed to raise a(m)-(kg) mower a distance of(6.00)(cm) above the ground to change a tire. If you had a(r)-(m) long lever, where would you place the fulcrum if your force was limited to(F)(N) and the mower was situated on the right end of the lever?
ans_rule(40)(m) from the right end of the lever

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(240,257,1)
r = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(2,3,1))
F = randrange(300,400,1)
g = 9.8
rr = (m*g)/F
r1 = r/(1+rr)
