## Question Section 

 
A researcher measures the wavelength of a(frequency,(GHz) electromagnetic wave to be(wavelength,(m).
Calculate the speed at which this wave propagates.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = randrange(1.1,1.3,0.01)
wavelength = randrange(0.475,0.525,0.025)

E = (frequency*10**9)*wavelength
