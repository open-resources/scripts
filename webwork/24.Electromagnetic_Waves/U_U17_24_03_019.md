## Question Section 

TV-reception antennas for VHF are constructed with cross wires supported at their centers. The ideal length for the cross wires is one-half the wavelength to be received, with the more expensive antennas having one for each channel. Suppose you measure the lengths of the wires for particular channels and find them to be(length_a) and(length_b,(m) long, respectively. What are the frequencies for these channels?
a)(length_a)(m:)
 
b)(length_b)(m:)
## A
and(length_b,(m) long, respectively. What are the frequencies for these channels?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length_a = randrange(1.85,1.95,0.01)
length_b = randrange(0.750,0.760,0.001)

E = (3*10**8)/(2*length_a)
F = (3*10**8)/(2*length_b)
