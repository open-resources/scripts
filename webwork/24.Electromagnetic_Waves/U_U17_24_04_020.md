## Question Section 

An LC circuit containing a(inductance,(H) inductor oscillates at such a frequency that it radiates at a(wavelength,(m) wavelength.
a) What is the capacitance of the circuit?
## A
What is the capacitance of the circuit?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance = randrange(1.9,2.1,0.01)
wavelength = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

E = ((wavelength**2)/(4*(pi**2)*inductance*(3*10**8)**2))*10**19
