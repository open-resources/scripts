## Question Section 

Lunar astronauts placed a reflector on the Moon's surface, off which a laser beam is periodically reflected. The distance to the Moon is calculated from the round-trip time.
a) To what accuracy in meters can the distance to the Moon be determined, if this time can be measured to(time)(ns)?
 
b) What percent accuracy is this, given the average distance to the Moon is(distance)(times 10^8)?
## A
To what accuracy in meters can the distance to the Moon be determined, if this time can be measured to(time)(ns)?
### Answer Section
## B
What percent accuracy is this, given the average distance to the Moon is(distance)(times 10^8)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001)
distance = randrange(3.80,3.88,0.01)

E = (3*10**8)*((time*10**-9)/2)
F = (E/(distance*10**8))*10**2
