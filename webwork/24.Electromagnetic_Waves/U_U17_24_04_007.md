## Question Section 

Lasers can be constructed that produce an extremely high intensity electromagnetic wave for a brief timeâ€”called pulsed lasers. They are used to ignite nuclear fusion, for example. Such a laser may produce an electromagnetic wave with a maximum electric field strength of(strength)(times 10^11,(Vm) for a time of(time,(ns).
a) What is the maximum magnetic field strength in the wave?
 
b) What is the intensity of the beam?
 
c) What energy does it deliver on a(area,(mm^2) area?
## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
time = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
area = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

E = (strength*10**11)/(3*10**8)
F = ((3*10**8)*(8.85*10**-12)*(strength*10**11)**2)/2
G = (F*(area*10**-6)*(time*10**-9))*10**-3
