## Question Section 

If you wish to detect details of the size of atoms (about(size)(times 10^-10,(m) ) with electromagnetic radiation, it must have a wavelength of about this size.
What is its frequency?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
size = randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05)

E = (3*10**8)/(size*10**-10)
