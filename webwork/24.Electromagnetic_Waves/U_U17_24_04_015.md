## Question Section 

Electromagnetic radiation from a(laser,(mW) laser is concentrated on a(area,(mm^2).
a) What is the intensity in(Wm^2)?
 
b) Suppose a(charge,(nC) static charge is in the beam. What is the maximum electric force it experiences?
 
c) If the static charge moves at(speed,(ms), what maximum magnetic force can it feel?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
laser = randrange(4.75,5.25,0.05)
area = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
charge = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
speed = randrange(375,425,1)

E = (laser*10**-3)/(area*10**-6)
F = ((2*E)/((3*10**8)*(8.85*10**-12)))**(1/2)
G = ((charge*10**-9)*speed*F)/(3*10**8)
