## Question Section 

What is the maximum electric field strength in an electromagnetic wave that has a maximum magnetic field strength of(strength)(times 10^-4,(T) (about 10 times the Earth's)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)

E = ((3*10**8)*(strength*10**-4))*10**-3
