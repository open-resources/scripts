## Question Section 

The maximum magnetic field strength of an electromagnetic field is(strength)(times 10^-6,(T). Calculate the maximum electric field strength if the wave is traveling in a medium in which the speed of the wave is(speed,(c).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01)
speed = randrange(0.70,0.80,0.05)

E = (speed*(3*10**8)*(strength*10**-6))*10**-3
