## Question Section 

What capacitance is needed in series with an(inductance,(mu)(H) inductor to form a circuit that radiates a wavelength of(wavelength,(m)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance = randrange(750,850,10)
wavelength = randrange(190,200,1)

E = ((wavelength**2)/(4*(pi**2)*(inductance*10**-6)*(3*10**8)**2))*10**12
