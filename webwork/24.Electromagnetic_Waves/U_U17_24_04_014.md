## Question Section 

On its highest power setting, a microwave oven increases the temperature of(mass,(kg) of spaghetti by(temp^circ(C) in(time,(s).
a) What was the rate of power absorption by the spaghetti, given that its specific heat is(3.76)(times 10^3,(Jkg^circ(C)?
 
b) Find the average intensity of the microwaves, given that they are absorbed over a circular area(diameter,(cm) in diameter.
 
c) What is the peak electric field strength of the microwave?
 
d) What is its peak magnetic field strength?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.375,0.425,0.005)
temp = randrange(42.5,47.5,0.1)
time = randrange(110,130,1)
diameter = randrange(18,22,1)
radius = (diameter*10**-2)/2

E = (mass*0.9*4186*temp)/(time)
F = E/(pi*radius**2)
G = ((2*F)/((3*10**8)*(8.85*10**-12)))**(1/2)
H = G/(3*10**8)
