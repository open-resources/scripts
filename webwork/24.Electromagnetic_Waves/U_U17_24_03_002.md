## A
Calculate the range of wavelengths for AM radio given its frequency range is(frequency_am_low) to(frequency_am_high,(kHz).
### Answer Section
## B
Do the same for the FM frequency range of(frequency_fm_low) to(frequency_fm_high,(MHz).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency_am_low = randrange(520,560,5)
frequency_am_high = randrange(1550,1650,5)
frequency_fm_low = randrange(83,92,0.5)
frequency_fm_high = randrange(105,111,1)

E = (3*10**8)/(frequency_am_low*10**3)
F = (3*10**8)/(frequency_am_high*10**3)
G = (3*10**8)/(frequency_fm_low*10**6)
H = (3*10**8)/(frequency_fm_high*10**6)
