## Question Section 

Assume the helium-neon lasers commonly used in student physics laboratories have power outputs of(output)(mW).
a) If such a laser beam is projected onto a circular spot(diameter,(mm) in diameter, what is its intensity?
 
b) Find the peak magnetic field strength.
 
c) Find the peak electric field strength.
## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
output = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.01)
diameter = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
radius = (diameter*10**-3)/2

E = (output*10**-3)/(pi*radius**2)
F = ((2*(4*pi*10**-7)*E)/(3*10**8))**(1/2)
G = 3*10**8*F
