## Question Section 

During a training exercise, Alice runs back and forth between two spots that are(a) m apart. She keeps up a constant speed of(b) ms, and we can assume that the time she takes to turn at the endpoints of her motion is negligible.
a) Determine the period of Alice's motion.
ans_rule(40) s
## A
m apart. She keeps up a constant speed of(b) ms, and we can assume that the time she takes to turn at the endpoints of her motion is negligible.
### Answer Section
## B
ms, and we can assume that the time she takes to turn at the endpoints of her motion is negligible.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

a = randrange(8,10,0.5)
b = randrange(4,6,0.2)
T = 2*a/b
f = 1/T
