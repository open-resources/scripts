## Question Section 

<b>
Two tuning forks having frequencies of(freq)(Hz) and(freq2)(Hz) are struck simultaneously. What average frequency will you hear, and what will the beat frequency be?
Average Frequency =ans_rule(20)(Hz)
Beat Frequency =ans_rule(20)(Hz)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
freq = randrange(440,455,1)
freq2 = randrange(456,470,1)

A1 = (freq2+freq)/2
A2 = freq2-freq
