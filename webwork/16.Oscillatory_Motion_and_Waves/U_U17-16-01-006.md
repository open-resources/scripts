## Question Section 

<b>
A spring has a length of(length1)(m) when a(mass1)(kg) mass hangs from it, and a length of(length2)(m) when a(mass2)(kg) mass hangs from it.
a)  What is the force constant of the spring? 
ans_rule(40)(Nm)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length1 = randrange(0.190,0.210,0.001)
mass1 = randrange(0.290,0.310,0.001)
length2 = randrange(0.700,0.800,0.01)
mass2 = randrange(1.90,2.10,0.01)
x = randrange(0.11,0.13,0.001)
A1 = (mass2 - mass1)*(9.80)/(length2 - length1)
A2 = (length2) - ((mass2)*(9.8))/(A1)
