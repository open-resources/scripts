## Question Section 

<b>
If a car has a suspension system with a force constant of(forcetimes 10^4)(Nm), how much energy must the car's shocks remove to dampen an oscillation starting with a maximum displacement of(displacement)(m)?
ans_rule(40)(J)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(3,9,0.1)
displacement = randrange(0.05,0.1,0.005)

A1 = (0.5)*((force)*(10)**(4))*((displacement)**(2))
