## Question Section 

<b>
One type of BB gun uses a spring-driven plunger to blow the BB from its barrel.
a)  Calculate the force constant of its plunger's spring if you must compress it(x)(m) to drive the(mass)(kg) plunger to a top speed of(v)(ms).
ans_rule(40)(Nm)
## A
 Calculate the force constant of its plunger's spring if you must compress it(x)(m) to drive the(mass)(kg) plunger to a top speed of(v)(ms).
### Answer Section
## G
plunger to a top speed of(v)(ms).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.04,0.06,0.001) 
x = randrange(0.140,0.160,0.001)  
v = randrange(17,23,0.1)
A1 = ((mass)*(v)*(v))/((x)*(x))
x2 = randrange(0.40,0.50,0.1)
A2 = (A1)*(x)
