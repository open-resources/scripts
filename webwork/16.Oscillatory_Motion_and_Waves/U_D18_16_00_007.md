## Question Section 

A spring rests at its equilibrium length of(24) cm, with one end hanging from a ceiling. You gently hang a block of mass(1.9) kg onto the end of the spring, the spring stretches beyond its equilibrium length, and you gently bring the spring to rest at its new equilibrium position, where its length is now(26.5) cm.
a) Determine the stiffness constant of the spring.
ans_rule(40) Nm
## A
Determine the stiffness constant of the spring.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

m = 1.9
g = 9.8
x = 0.025
k = m*g/x
E = 0.5*k*(x**2)
