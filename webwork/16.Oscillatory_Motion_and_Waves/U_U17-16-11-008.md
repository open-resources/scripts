## Question Section 

<b>
A microphone receiving a pure sound tone feeds an oscilloscope, producing a wave on its screen. If the sound intensity is originally(intensitytimes 10^-5)(Wm^2), but is turned up until the amplitude increases by(30.0)(%), what is the new intensity?
ans_rule(40)(Wm^2)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
intensity = randrange(1,3,0.01)

A1 = ((intensity)*(10)**(-5))*(1.3)**(2)
