## Question Section 

<b>
Engineering Application: A device called an insolation meter is used to measure the intensity of sunlight has an area of(area)(cm^2) and registers(power)(W). What is the intensity?
ans_rule(40)(Wm^2)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
power = randrange(5,10,0.01)
area = randrange(50,150,1)

A1 = power/(area*(10)**(-4))
