## Question Section 

<b>
A child bounces in a harness suspended from a door frame by a spring constant.
a)  If the spring stretches(stretch1)(m) while supporting an(mass)-(kg) child, what is its spring constant? 
ans_rule(40) (Nm)
## A
 If the spring stretches(stretch1)(m) while supporting an(mass)-(kg) child, what is its spring constant? 
### Answer Section
## G
child, what is its spring constant? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,0.1) 
stretch1 = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.05)
Amplitude = randrange(0.1,0.2,0.05)

A1 = (mass)*(9.80)/(stretch1)
A2 = 2*pi*((mass)/A1)**(1/2)
A3 = (Amplitude)*((A1)/(mass))**(1/2)
