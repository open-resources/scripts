## Question Section 

<b>
The low-frequency speaker of a stereo set has a surface area of(SA)(m^2) and produces(1)(W)  of acoustical power. 
a) What is the intensity at the speaker?
ans_rule(40)(Wm^2)
## A
What is the intensity at the speaker?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
intensity = randrange(0.08,0.15,0.001)
SA = randrange(0.01,0.079,0.001)

A1 = 1/(SA) 
A2 = sqrt((1/(intensity))/((4)*(pi)))
