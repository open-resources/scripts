## Question Section 

<b>
Seismographs measure the arrival times of earthquakes with a precision of(0.100)(s). To get the distance to the epicenter of the quake, they compare the arrival times of S- and P-waves, which travel at different speeds. If S- and P-waves travel at(S)(kms) and(P)(kms), respectively, in the region considered, how precisely can the distance to the source of the earthquake be determined?
ans_rule(40)(km)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
S = randrange(3,5,0.1)
P = randrange(6,8,0.1)

A1 = ((P)-(S))*(0.1)
