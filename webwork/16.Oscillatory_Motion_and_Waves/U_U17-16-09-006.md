## Question Section 

<b>
What is the wavelength of the waves you create in a swimming pool if you splash your hand at a rate of(freq)(Hz) and the waves propagate at(speed)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(0.5,1.5,0.01)
freq = randrange(1,3,0.01)

A1 = (speed)/(freq)
