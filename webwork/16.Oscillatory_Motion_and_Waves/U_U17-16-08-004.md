## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have a(mass)-(kg) object on a horizontal surface connected to a spring that has a force constant of(force)(Nm). There is simple friction between the object and surface with a static coefficient of friction(sfriction).
a) How far can the spring be stretched without moving the mass?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.5,1,0.01)
force = randrange(100,200,1)
sfriction = randrange(0.1,0.2,0.005)
kfriction = randrange(0.06,0.1,0.001)

A1 = (sfriction)*(mass)*(9.8)/(force)
A2 = ((0.5)*(force)*(((2)*(A1))**(2)))/((kfriction)*(mass)*(9.8))
