## Question Section 

<b>
If a pendulum-driven clock gains(s)(sday), what fractional change in pendulum length must be made for it to keep perfect time?
L(_f) =ans_rule(20) L(_i)
where L(_f) is the final length and L(_i) is the initial length.
## F
=ans_rule(20) L(_i)
### Answer Section
## I
is the initial length.

from random import randrange
s = randrange(5.00,10.00,1) 

A1 = ((86400 + s)/(86400))**(2)
