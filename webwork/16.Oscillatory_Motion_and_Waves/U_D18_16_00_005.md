## Question Section 

A spring that has stiffness constant(224) Nm rests at its equilibrium length of(14) cm, with one end hanging from a ceiling. You gently hang a block of mass(2.1) kg onto the end of the spring, the spring stretches beyond its equilibrium length, and you gently bring the spring to rest at its new equilibrium position.
a) Determine the magnitude of the displacement of the spring.
ans_rule(40) cm
## A
Determine the magnitude of the displacement of the spring.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

k = 224
m = 2.1
g = 9.8
x = m*g/k
xcm = 100*x
E = 0.5*k*(x**2)
