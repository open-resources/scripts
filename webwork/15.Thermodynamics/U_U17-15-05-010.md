 mca -> print_q()
 mca -> print_a()


## Answer Section

mca = new_multiple_choice()

mca -> qa ("Which of the following relationships exists between the coefficients of performance of a refrigerator and a heat pump?", "\(\textrm{COP}\)\(_R\) \(\textrm{=}\) \(\textrm{COP}\)\(_H_P\) \(\textrm{- 1}\) PAR")

mca -> extra ("\(\textrm{COP}\)\(_R\) \(\textrm{=}\) \(\textrm{COP}\)\(_H_P\) \(\textrm{+ 1}\) PAR", "\(\textrm{COP}\)\(_H_P\) \(\textrm{=}\) \(\textrm{COP}\)\(_R\) \(\textrm{- 1}\) PAR", "\(\textrm{COP}\)\(_R\) \(\textrm{=}\) \(\textrm{COP}\)\(_H_P\) \(\textrm{+ 1}\) PAR")
