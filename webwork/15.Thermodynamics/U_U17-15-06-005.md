## Question Section 

<b>
The Sun radiates energy at the rate of(ratetimes 10^26)(W) from its(6000)(K) surface into dark empty space. The effective temperature of deep space is(-270^circC).
a) What is the increase in entropy in one day due to this heat transfer?
ans_rule(40)(JK)
## A
What is the increase in entropy in one day due to this heat transfer?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
rate = randrange(3,5,0.01)

A1 = (rate*(10**(26)))*(86400)*((1/(273.15-270))-(1/(6000)))
A2 = (A1)*(273.15-270)
