## Question Section 

<b>
A(4)-ton air conditioner removes(heattimes 10^7)(J) from a cold environment in one hour.
a) What energy input in joules is necessary to do this if the air conditioner has an energy efficiency rating of(perf)? There are(1055)(JBTU).
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A
What energy input in joules is necessary to do this if the air conditioner has an energy efficiency rating of(perf)? There are(1055)(JBTU).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heat = randrange(2,9,0.01)
perf = randrange(5,15,0.1)
A1 = (heat*(10**(7)))/((perf)*((1055))*(1/3600))
A2 = (A1)*((10)/(3600000))
