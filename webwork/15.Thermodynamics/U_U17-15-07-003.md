If tossing(100) coins, how many ways (microstates) are there to get the three most likely macrostates of(49) heads and(51) tails,(50) heads and(50) tails, and(51) heads and(49) tails? 
### Answer Section
## B
What percent of the total possibilities is this?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

ways = 2*9.9*10**28+1*10**29
totalmicrostates = 1.27*10**30

percent = ways/totalmicrostates*100
