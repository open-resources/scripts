ans_rule(40)(JK)
## G
of liquid nitrogen that evaportaes at its boiling temperature,(tempK)(K). The latent heat of vaporization is equal to(Lv)(Jkg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
tempK = 77.35
mass  = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(1,1.1,0.005))
Lv = 201000

deltaS = ((Lv*mass)/tempK)
