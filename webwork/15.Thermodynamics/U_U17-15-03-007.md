## Question Section 

<b>
Assume that the turbines at a coal-powered power plant were upgraded, resulting in an improvement in efficiency of(eff)(%). Assume that prior to the upgrade the power station had an efficiency of(eff2)(%) and that the heat transfer into the engine in one day is still the same at(heattimes 10^14)(J).
a) How much more electrical energy is produced due to the upgrade?
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A
How much more electrical energy is produced due to the upgrade?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(2,7,0.01)
eff2 = randrange(30,50,0.01)
heat = randrange(1,6,0.01)
A1 = (eff/100)*(heat*(10**(14)))
A2 = -A1
