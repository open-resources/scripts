## Question Section 

<b>
An ideal heat pump is being considered for use in heating an environment with a temperature of (temp^circC). What is the cold reservoir temperature if the pump is to have a coefficient of performance of(perf)?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
perf = randrange(7,15,0.01)
temp = randrange(10,30,0.1)
A1 = ((temp+273.15)*((1)-(1/perf)))-273.15
