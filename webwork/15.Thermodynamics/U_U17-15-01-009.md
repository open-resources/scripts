## Question Section 

<b>
A woman climbing the Washington Monument metabolizes(energy)(kJ)  of food energy. If her efficiency is(eff)(%), how much heat transfer occurs to the environment to keep her temperature constant? 
ans_rule(40)(J)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(300,900,0.1)
eff = randrange(10,25,0.1)

A1 = (-(eff/100)+1)*(energy)
