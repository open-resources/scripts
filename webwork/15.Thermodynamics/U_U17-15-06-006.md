### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = sprintf("%0.2f",1)
temphot = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(30,60,0.1))
temphotK = temphot+273.15
tempcold = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(1,29,0.1))
tempcoldK = tempcold+273.15
tempeq = 0.5*(temphot+tempcold)

A1 = (1)*(4186)*(tempeq-tempcold)
A2 = (A1)*(1/(tempcoldK)-1/(temphotK))
A3 = (A2)*(tempcoldK)
