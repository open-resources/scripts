## Question Section 

<b>
a) How much heat transfer occurs from(mass)(kg) of(temphigh^circC) water placed in contact with(mass)(kg) of(templow^circC) water, producing a final temperature of(tempave^circC)?
b) How much work could a Carnot engine do with this heat transfer, assuming it operates between two reservoirs at constant temperatures of(temphigh^circC) and(templow^circC)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,30,0.1))
temphigh = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(70,99,0.1))
temphighK = temphigh+273.15
templow = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,20,0.1))
templowK = templow+273.15
tempave = (temphigh+templow)/2
heatcap = 4186

heat = abs((mass)*(heatcap)*(tempave-temphigh))
work = (heat)*(1-(templowK)/(temphighK))
