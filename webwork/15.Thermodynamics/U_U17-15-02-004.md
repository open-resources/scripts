## Question Section 

<b>
A hand-driven tire pump has a piston with a(diameter)-(cm) diameter and a maximum stroke of(stroke)(cm).
a) How much work do you do in one stroke if the average gauge pressure is (pressuretimes 10^5)(Nm^2)?
ans_rule(40)(J)
## A
How much work do you do in one stroke if the average gauge pressure is (pressuretimes 10^5)(Nm^2)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(1,5,0.01)
stroke = randrange(25,40,0.01)
pressure = randrange(1,5,0.01)

A1 = (pressure*(10**(5)))*(pi)*(stroke/100)*((diameter/200)**(2))
A2 = (A1)/(stroke/100)
