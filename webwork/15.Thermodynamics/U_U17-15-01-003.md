## Question Section 

<b>
A system does(worktimes 10^8)(J) of work while(heattimes 10^8)(J) of heat transfer occurs to the environment. What is the change in internal energy of the system assuming no other changes (such as in temperature or by the addition of fuel)?
ans_rule(40)(J)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
work = randrange(1,6,0.01)
heat = randrange(7,9.99,0.01)

A1 = (-(heat)-(work))*(10**(8))
