to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
You can sometimes find deep red crystal vases in antique stores, called uranium glass because their colour was produced by doping the glass with uranium. Calculate the activity of such a vase assuming it has(massU,g) of uranium in it. Neglect the activity of any daughter nuclides.

## G
of uranium in it. Neglect the activity of any daughter nuclides. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

massU = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
atomsmol = 6.022*10**23
N235 = (atomsmol/235)*massU*0.00720
N238 = (atomsmol/238)*massU*0.99274
thalf235 = (7.04*10**8)*(3.156*10**7)
thalf238 = (4.468*10**9)*(3.156*10**7)
R235 = (0.693*N235)/(thalf235)
R238 = (0.693*N238)/(thalf238)
R = R235 + R238
