## Question Section 

<b>
The detail observable using a probe is limited by its wavelength. Calculate the energy of a(gamma)-ray photon that has a wavelength of(wavelengthtimes 10^-16,m), small enough to detect details about one-tenth the size of a nucleon. 
Note that a photon having this energy is difficult to produce and interacts poorly with the nucleus, limiting the practicability of this probe.
ans_rule(40)(GeV)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-16

energySI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI)
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-9
