## Question Section 

<center> 

<b>
Devise an equation giving half-life as a function of the energy released in(alpha) decay using the data in the table above. It may be useful to graph the log of half-life against  energy to find some straight-line relationship.
Slope:ans_rule(40)(MeV^-1)
Intercept:ans_rule(40)(s)
