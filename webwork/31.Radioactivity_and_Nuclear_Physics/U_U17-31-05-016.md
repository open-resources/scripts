World War II aircraft had instruments with glowing radium-painted dials, as shown in the figure above. The activity of one such instrument was(activity_1times 10^5,Bq) when new.
 
a) What mass of(,^MRa) was present?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

activity_1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.25,1.75,0.05))
activity_1SI = activity_1*10**5
half_life = 1.6*10**3
half_lifeSI = half_life*(365.25*86400)
M = 226
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(55,60,0.5))

mass_g = (activity_1SI*half_lifeSI*M)/(0.693*Na)
mass = mass_g*10**6
activity_2SI = (activity_1SI)*exp(-ln(2)*time/half_life)
