## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Z_12 = 6
N_12 = 6

Z_14 = 6
N_14 = 8

mass_carbon_12 = 12
mass_carbon_14 = 14.003241
mass_proton = 1.007825
mass_neutron = 1.008665

binding_energy_per_A_12 = (931.5)*(Z_12*mass_proton + N_12*mass_neutron - mass_carbon_12)/(Z_12 + N_12)

binding_energy_per_A_14 = (931.5)*(Z_14*mass_proton + N_14*mass_neutron - mass_carbon_14)/(Z_14 + N_14)
