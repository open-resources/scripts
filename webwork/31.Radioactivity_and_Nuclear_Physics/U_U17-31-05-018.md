to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
Armour-piercing shells with depleted uranium cores are fired by aircraft at tanks. (The high density of the uranium makes them effective.) The uranium is called depleted because it has had its(,^235U) removed for reactor use and is nearly pure(,^238U). Depleted uranium has been erroneously called non-radioactive. To demonstrate that this is wrong: 
a) Calculate the activity of(massU,g) of pure(,^238U).
ans_rule(40)(Bq)
## A
Calculate the activity of(massU,g) of pure(,^238U).
### Answer Section
## G
of pure(,^238U).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

massU = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(60, 65, 0.5))
atomsmol = 6.022*10**23
N238 = (atomsmol/238)*massU
thalf235 = (7.04*10**8)*(3.156*10**7)
thalf238 = (4.47*10**9)*(3.156*10**7)
R238a = (0.693*N238)/(thalf238)
N235 = (atomsmol/235)*massU*0.00720
R235 = (0.693*N235)/(thalf235)
R238 = 0.992745*R238a
R = R235+R238
