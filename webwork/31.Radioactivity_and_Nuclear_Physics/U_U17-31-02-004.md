## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a particle of ionizing radiation deposits(energy_MeV,MeV) in the gas of a Geiger tube, all of which goes to creating ion pairs. Each ion pair requires(energy_per_pair,eV) of energy. 
a) The applied voltage sweeps the ions out of the gas in(time) μs. What is the current?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

m = randrange(950,975,5)          #Part B multiplicative factor.
energy_MeV = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
energy = energy_MeV*10**6
energy_per_pair = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(40,45,0.5))
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.75,2.25,0.05))
timeSI = time*10**-6

n = (energy/energy_per_pair)
n_rateSI = (n/timeSI)
current_aSI = (n_rateSI*e)
current_a = current_aSI*10**9
current_bSI = (m*current_aSI)
current_b = current_bSI*10**6
