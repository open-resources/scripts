## Question Section 

<b>
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the(alpha) decay of(,^210Po), the isotope of polonium in the decay series of(,^238U) that was discovered by the Curies. A favorite isotope in physics labs, it has a short half-life and decays to a stable nuclide.
<center>(^210_84Po_126,,longrightarrow,, ^a_bPb_c,,+,, ^4_2He_2)<center>
(a) =ans_rule(10)
(b) =ans_rule(10)
