## Question Section 

<center> 

<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A particle physicist discovers a neutral particle with a mass of(,mass_particle,u) that he assumes is two neutrons bound together. Find its binding energy.  
ans_rule(40)(MeV)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass_neutron = 1.008665
mass_particle = sprintf("%0.5f", randrange(2.02725,2.02775,0.00005))

binding_energy = (931.5)*(2*mass_neutron - mass_particle)
