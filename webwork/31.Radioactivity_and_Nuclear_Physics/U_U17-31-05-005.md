Mantles for gas lanterns contain thorium, because it forms an oxide that can survive being heated to incandescence for long periods of time. If an average lantern mantle contains(mass,mg) of thorium, what is its activity? Natural thorium is almost(100%, ^232Th).

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

half_life = 1.41*10**10
mass = randrange(350,400,5)
mass_g = mass*10**-3
M = 232

timeSI = (half_life*86400*365.25)
N = (mass_g/M)*(Na)
activitySI = (0.693*N)/(timeSI)
