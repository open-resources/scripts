## Question Section 

<b>
There is more than one isotope of natural uranium. If a researcher isolates(mass,mg) of the relatively scarce(,^MU) and finds this mass to have an activity of(activitySI,Bq), what is its half-life in years?
ans_rule(40) years

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

n = randrange(1 ,3, 1)         #To avoid using unrelated randrange variables for activity and mass.

activitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", n*80)
mass = sprintf("%0.2f", n)
mass_g = mass*10**-3
M = 235

timeSI= (0.693*Na*mass_g)/(activitySI*M)
half_life = (timeSI)/(86400*365.25)*10**-8
