## Question Section 

<center> 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A frazzled theoretical physicist reckons that all conservation laws are obeyed in the decay of a proton into a neutron, positron, and neutrino (as in(beta^+) decay of a nucleus) and sends a paper to a journal to announce the reaction as a possible end of the universe due to the spontaneous decay of protons. 
What energy is released in this decay?
ans_rule(40)(MeV)


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass_electron = 0.0005485
mass_neutron = 1.008665
mass_proton = 1.007276

energy = (931.5)*(mass_proton - mass_neutron - mass_electron)
