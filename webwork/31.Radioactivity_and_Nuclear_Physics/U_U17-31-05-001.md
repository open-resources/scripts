An old campfire is uncovered during an archaeological dig. Its charcoal is found to contain less than(,fracn1000) the normal amount of(,^14C). Estimate the minimum age of the charcoal.
ans_rule(40) years


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

half_life = 5730
n = randrange(1,10,1)
ratio = n*10**-3

time = -(half_life*ln(ratio))/ln(2)
