Large amounts of depleted uranium(:^2 3 8U) are available as a by-product of uranium processing for reactor fuel and weapons. Uranium is very dense and makes good 
counter weights for aircraft. Suppose you have a(mass,kg) block of(:^2 3 8U).
 
a) Find its activity.
ans_rule(40)(Ci)
## A
Find its activity.
### Answer Section
## G
block of(:^2 3 8U).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass = randrange(4000, 4500, 50)
ukg = 1/(1.6605*10**-27)
thalf238 = (4.468*10**9)*(3.156*10**7)
decay = 4.27
Ro = ((0.693*mass*ukg)/(238.050784*thalf238))/(3.7*10**10)
Energy = (5*10**10)*decay*(1.602*10**-19)*(8.64*10**4)*(1/4.186)
