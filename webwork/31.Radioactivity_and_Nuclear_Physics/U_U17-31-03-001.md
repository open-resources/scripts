## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the side lengths of a(masstimes 10^17,kg) cube of water at(4^circC). (This mass at nuclear density would make a cube about(length_nuclear,m) on a side.)
ans_rule(40)(km)
## G
cube of water at(4^circC). (This mass at nuclear density would make a cube about(length_nuclear,m) on a side.)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

p_nuclearSI = 2.3*10**17
p_waterSI = 10**3

mass = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
massSI = mass*10**17

volume_waterSI = (massSI/p_waterSI)
length_waterSI = (volume_waterSI)**(1/3)
length_water = length_waterSI*10**-3

#Taken from Exercise 31.1 of the textboook.

length_nuclearSI = (massSI/p_nuclearSI)**(1/3)
length_nuclear = sprintf("%0.2f", length_nuclearSI)
