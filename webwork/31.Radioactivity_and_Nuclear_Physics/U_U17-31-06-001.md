(, ^2H) is a loosely bound isotope of hydrogen. Called deuterium or heavy hydrogen, it is stable but relatively rareâ€”it is(0.015,%) of natural hydrogen. Note that deuterium has and equal number of protons and neutrons, which should tend to make it more tightly bound, but both are odd numbers. Calculate the binding energy per nucleon.
ans_rule(40)(MeV)


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass_deuterium = 2.014102
mass_neutron = 1.008665
mass_proton = 1.007825
nucleons = 2

delta_mass = (mass_proton  + mass_neutron - mass_deuterium)
energy = (931.5)*(delta_mass)
energy_per_nucleon = (energy/nucleons)
