## A
Calculate the mass converted to energy by the fission of(1.00) kg of uranium if it releases(8times10^13J) of energy. 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Energy = 8*(10**13)
c = 2.998*(10**8)
Mass = Energy/(c**2)
Massgrams = Mass*1000
ratio = Mass/(1**2)
