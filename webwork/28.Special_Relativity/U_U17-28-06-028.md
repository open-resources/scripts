## Question Section 

A proton has a mass of(1.67times 10^-27) kg. A physicist measures the proton's total energy to be(Energy) MeV. 
What is the proton's kinetic energy? 
ans_rule(40) MeV
Unreasonable Results: Notice that the calculated result is negative, but the proton must have a positive value for kinetic energy.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mc = 938.3
Energy = randrange(45,55,1)
gamma = Energy/mc
KineticEnergy = (gamma-1)*mc
