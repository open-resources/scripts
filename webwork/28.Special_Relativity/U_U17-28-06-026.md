## Question Section 

Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount. 
a) What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of(radiuskm) km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.)
ans_rule(40)
b) If the ship has a mass of(1.00times 10^5) kg ((100) tons), what total yield nuclear explosion in tons of TNT is needed if it releases(4.2times10^9,Jton)?
ans_rule(40) tons of TNT

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 2.998*(10**8)
mass = 1*(10**5)
gravity = 9.8
radiuskm = randrange(210,270,1)
radiusorbit = radiuskm*(10**3)
radiusearth = 6.37*(10**6)
radius = radiusearth+radiusorbit
G = 6.67*(10**-11)
Mass = 5.98*(10**24)
KineticEnergy = (G*Mass*mass)/(2*radius)
PotentialEnergy = mass*gravity*radiusorbit
Energytotal = KineticEnergy+PotentialEnergy
masstotal = Energytotal/(c**2)
ratio = masstotal/mass
massTNT = Energytotal/(4.2*(10**9))
