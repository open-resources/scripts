## Question Section 

Alpha decay is nuclear decay in which a helium nucleus is emitted. If the helium
nucleus has a mass of(6.8times 10^-27) kg and is given(EnergyMeV) MeV of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 6.8*(10**-27)
EnergyMeV = 5
KineticEnergy = EnergyMeV*(1.6*(10**-13))
c = (2.998*(10**8))**2
gamma = (KineticEnergy+(mass*c))/(mass*c)
velocity = (1-(1/(gamma**2)))**(1/2)
