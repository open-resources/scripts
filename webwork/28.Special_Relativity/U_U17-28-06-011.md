## A
Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of a(mass)-kg car moving at(velocitycar) ms if the speed of light were only(velocitylight) ms. 
### Answer Section
## B
Find the ratio of the relativistic kinetic energy to classical.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass = randrange(1000,1500,1)
velocitycar = randrange(30,35,1)
velocitylight = randrange(45,50,1)
gamma = (1-((velocitycar**2)/(velocitylight**2)))**(-1/2)
KineticEnergy = (gamma-1)*mass*(velocitylight**2)
KineticEnergye = 0.5*mass*(velocitycar**2)
ratio = KineticEnergy/KineticEnergye
