## Question Section 

a) A barrel of crude oil can release(5.90times 10^9) J of energy. Find the mass destroyed when this energy is released.
ans_rule(40) kg
b) Given these barrels contain(litres) litres and assuming the density of crude oil is(density)(kgm^3), what is the ratio of mass destroyed to original mass?

### Answer Section
## B
Given these barrels contain(litres) litres and assuming the density of crude oil is(density)(kgm^3), what is the ratio of mass destroyed to original mass?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Energy = 5.9*10**9
litres = randrange(150,250,1)
c = 2.998*(10**8)
density = 750
Mass = Energy/(c**2)
mass = (litres/1000)*(density)
ratio = Mass/mass
