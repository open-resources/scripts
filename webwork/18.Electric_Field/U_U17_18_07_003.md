## Question Section 

a) Find the total electric field of line (a) at(x=5.00,cm) as shown in the above image given that(q=1.00,muC).
ans_rule(40) NC
b) At what position between(3.00) and(8.00,cm) is the total electric field the same as that for(-2q) alone?
ans_rule(40) cm
c) Can the electric field be zero anywhere between 0 and 8 cm?
Enter 0 for yes and 1 for no.
ans_rule(40) 
d) At very large positive and negative values of x, the electric field approaches zero on lines (a) and (b). In which does it most rapidly approach zero?
Enter 0 for (a) and 1 for (b).
ans_rule(40) 
e) At what position to the right of 11cm is the total electric field zero, other than at infinity?
ans_rule(40) cm
