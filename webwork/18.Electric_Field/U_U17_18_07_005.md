## Question Section 

Calculate the magnitude of the force on the charge(q), given that the square is(10,cm) on a side and(q=2.00,muC), given that(q_a=q_b=+A,muC) and(q_c=q_d=-A,muC).
ans_rule(40) N


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
A = randrange(7,8,0.02)
B = A*10**-6
d = 0.1
r = d/2*sqrt(2)
F = 4*0.707106781*(8.99*10**9*2*10**-6*B/r**2)
