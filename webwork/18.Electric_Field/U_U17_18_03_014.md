## Question Section 

A certain five cent coin contains(a) g of nickel. What fraction of the nickel atoms' electrons, removed and placed(r1) m above it, would support the weight of this coin? 
The atomic mass of nickel is(58.7), and each nickel atom contains(28) electrons and(28) protons.
ans_rule(40) m
## A
g of nickel. What fraction of the nickel atoms' electrons, removed and placed(r1) m above it, would support the weight of this coin? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(1.46,9.99,0.49)
m = a*(10**(-3))

q1 = (1.6)*(10**-19)
q = q1**2
g = 9.80
k = 8.99*(10**9)
Na = 6.02*(10**(23))
r1 = randrange(1.02,9.99,0.93)
r = r1**2
m = 1.67*(10**-27)
Ne = (28*Na)*(m/58.7)
N = ((g*r*m)/(k*q))**(1/2)
NNe = N/Ne
