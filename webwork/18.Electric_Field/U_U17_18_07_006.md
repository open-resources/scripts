## Question Section 

Calculate the magnitude of the electric field at the location of charge(q), given that the square is(5.00,cm) on a side and(q=2.00,muC), given that(q_a=q_b=+A,muC) and(q_c=q_d=-A,muC).
ans_rule(40) NC


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
A = randrange(0.5,1.0,0.02)
B = A*10**-6
d = 0.05
r = d/2*sqrt(2)
E = 4*(8.99*10**9*B/r**2)*sin(45*pi/180)
