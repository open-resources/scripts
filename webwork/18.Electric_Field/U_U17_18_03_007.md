## Question Section 

A test charge of(+2,muC) is placed halfway between a charge of(+6,muC) and another of(+4,muC) separated by(10) cm.
What is the magnitude of the force on the test charge?
ans_rule(40) N


## Answer Section

q = 2*(10**-6)
q2 = 6*(10**-6)
q1 = 4*(10**-6)
r = 0.05**2
k = 8.99*10**9
F1 = (q*q1*k)/r
F2 = (q*q2*k)/r
Ftot = F2-F1
