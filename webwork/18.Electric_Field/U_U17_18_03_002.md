## Question Section 

Common static electricity involves charges ranging from nanocoulombs to microcoulombs. 
How strong is the attractive force between a glass rod with a(a) μC charge and a silk cloth with a(-c) μC charge, which are(e) cm apart, using the approximation that they act like point charges?
ans_rule(40) N
## A
μC charge and a silk cloth with a(-c) μC charge, which are(e) cm apart, using the approximation that they act like point charges?
### Answer Section

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(0.034,0.999,0.103) 
q1 = (a)*(10**-6)
c = randrange(0.029,0.981,0.043)   
q2 = (c)*(10**-6)
e = randrange(10.0,19.0,0.47)
f = e/100
r = f**2
k = 8.99*10**9
i = (q1*q2)/r
f = i*k
