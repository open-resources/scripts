## Question Section 

Bare free charges do not remain stationary when close together. To illustrate this, calculate the acceleration of two isolated protons separated by(rnm) nm (a typical distance between gas atoms).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

rnm = randrange(1.02,9.00,0.17)
r = (rnm*(10**-9))**2
q = (1.6*(10**-19))**2
k = 8.99*(10**9)
m = 1.67*(10**-27)
acceleration = (q*k)/(m*r)
