## Question Section 

a) Find the electric field at the center of the triangular configuration of charges above, given that(q_a=+2.50,nC),(q_b=-8.00,nC), and(q_c=+1.50,nC)
ans_rule(40) NC
b) Is there any combination of charges, other than(q_a=q_b=q_c) that will produce a zero strength electric field at the center of the triangular configuration?
Enter 0 for yes and 1 for no.
ans_rule(40) N
