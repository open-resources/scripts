## Question Section 

If two equal charges each of(q1) C each are separated in air by a distance of(c) km, what is the magnitude of the force acting between them? 
You will see that even at a distance as large as(c) km, the repulsive force is substantial because(q1) C is a very significant amount of charge.
ans_rule(40) N
## C
km, what is the magnitude of the force acting between them? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
q1 = randrange(1.00,10.00,0.16)
q = q1**2
c = randrange(1.00,10.00,1.04)
d = c*(10**(3))
r = d**2
k = 8.99*(10**9)
F = (q*k)/(r)
