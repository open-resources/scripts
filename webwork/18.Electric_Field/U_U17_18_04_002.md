## Question Section 

What is the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on a(q1) Î¼C charge by a(E) NC electric field that points due east?
ans_rule(40) N


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
q1 = randrange(1.01,8.04,0.03)
q = q1*(10**-6) 
E = randrange(100.00,400.99,13.14)   
F = q*E
