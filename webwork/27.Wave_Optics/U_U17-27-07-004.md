## Question Section 

Find the minimum thickness of a soap bubble that appears red when illuminated by white light perpendicular to its surface. Take the wavelength to be(wave,(nm), and assume the same index of refraction as water ((1.33)).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(600,760,0.1)

A1 = (wave*(10**(-9)))*(10**(9))/((4)*(1.33))
