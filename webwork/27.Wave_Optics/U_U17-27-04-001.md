## Question Section 

A diffraction grating has(lines) lines per centimeter. At what angle will the first-order maximum be for(wave,(nm) wavelength green light?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
lines = randrange(1500,3000,1)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = asin((wave*(10**(-9)))/((0.01)/(lines)))*(180/pi)
