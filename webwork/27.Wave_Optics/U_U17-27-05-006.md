## Question Section 

Calculate the wavelength of light that produces its first minimum at an angle of(angle ^circ) when falling on a single slit of width (dtimes 10^-6,(m).
## C
when falling on a single slit of width (dtimes 10^-6,(m).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
d = randrange(1,5,0.01)
A1 = (d*(10**(-6)))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
