## Answer Section

from random import randrange
do {
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
d = randrange(2,7,0.01)
angle = randrange(70,90,0.1)
} until (abs((3)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(d*(10**(-6)))) < 1)
A1 = asin((3)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(d*(10**(-6))))*(180/pi)
A2 = (3)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))
