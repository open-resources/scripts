## Question Section 

A soap bubble is(thick,(nm) thick and illuminated by white light incident perpendicular to its surface. What wavelength and color of visible light is most constructively reflected, assuming the same index of refraction as water ((1.33))?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
thick = randrange(50,180,0.1)

A1 = (4)*(1.33)*(thick*(10**(-9)))
