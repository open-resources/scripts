## Question Section 

How many lines per centimeter are there on a diffraction grating that gives a first-order maximum for(wave,(nm) light at an angle of(angle) degrees ?
ans_rule(40)
## E
degrees ?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (0.01)*(sin(angle*(pi/180)))/(wave*(10**(-9)))
