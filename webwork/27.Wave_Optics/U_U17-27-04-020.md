## Question Section 

Light of wavelength of(wave,(nm) falls on a double slit separated by(slit,(nm). At what angle is the first-order maximum in the diffraction pattern?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
slit = randrange(500,760,0.1)
wave = randrange(380,490,0.1)
A1 = asin((wave)/(slit))*(180/pi)
