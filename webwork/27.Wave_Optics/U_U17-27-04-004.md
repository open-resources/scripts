## Question Section 

What is the distance between lines on a diffraction grating that produces a second-order maximum for(wave,(nm) light at an angle of(angle) degrees ?
## E
degrees ?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (2)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))
