## Question Section 

Diffraction spreading for a flashlight is insignificant compared with other limitations in its optics, such as spherical aberrations in its mirror. To show this, calculate the minimum angular spreading of a flashlight beam that is originally(d,(cm) in diameter with an average wavelength of(wave,(nm).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
d = randrange(1,10,0.01)
A1 = (1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(d/100)
