## Question Section 

An opal such as that shown above acts like a reflection grating with rows separated by about(w)(mu)(m). If the opal is illuminated normally, 
(a) At what angle will red light ((700(nm)) be seen?
 
(b) At what angle will blue light ((460(nm)) be seen?
## A
At what angle will red light ((700(nm)) be seen?
### Answer Section
## B
At what angle will blue light ((460(nm)) be seen?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
w = randrange(7.5,8.5,0.1)

P1 = 7*(10**(-7))/(w*(10**(-6)))
A1= asin(P1)*180/pi
P2 = 4.6*(10**(-7))/(w*(10**(-6)))
A2 = asin(P2)*180/pi
