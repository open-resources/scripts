## Question Section 

Analysis of an interference effect in a clear solid shows that the wavelength of light in the solid is(a,(nm). Knowing this light comes from a He-Ne laser and has a wavelength of(b,(nm) in air, find the index of refraction.
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(380,500,0.1)
b = randrange(501,760,0.1)
A1 = (b)/(a)
