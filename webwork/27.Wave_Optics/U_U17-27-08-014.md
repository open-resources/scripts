## Question Section 

If(x) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from the top of an interface between two substances, and(y) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from below, prove that(x) +(y) =(90.0^circ).
Use(n) to represent(n)<sub>1<sub>, and use(N) to represent(n)<sub>2<sub>
(tan(x)) =ans_rule(40)
(tan(y)) =ans_rule(40)
Using trigonometric identities to equate the two expressions above;
(tan(x)) =ans_rule(40)
In terms of(y), angle(x) equalsans_rule(40)
Therefore,(x) +(y) equalans_rule(40)
