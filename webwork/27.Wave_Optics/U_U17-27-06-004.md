## Question Section 

a) What is the minimum angular spread of a(wave,(nm) wavelength He-Ne laser beam that is originally(1.00,(mm) in diameter?
b) If this laser is aimed at a mountain cliff(d,(km) away, how big will the illuminated spot be? 
c) How big a spot would be illuminated on the Moon, neglecting atmospheric effects? The distance to the moon is(382) million meters.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
d = randrange(10,30,0.1)
A1 = (1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(0.001)
A2 = (0.001)+(2)*((d*(1000))*(A1))
A3 = (2)*(3.82*(10**(8)))*(A1)
