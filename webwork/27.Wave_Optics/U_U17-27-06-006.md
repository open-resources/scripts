## Question Section 

The limit to the eye's acuity is actually related to diffraction by the pupil. 
a) What is the angle between two just-resolvable points of light for a(d,(mm) diameter pupil, assuming an average wavelength of(wave,(nm)? 
b) Take your result to be the practical limit for the eye. What is the greatest possible distance a car can be from you if you can resolve its two headlights, given they are(1.30,(m) apart?
c) What is the distance between two just-resolvable points held at an arm's length of(0.800,(m) from your eye?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
d = randrange(2,5,0.01)
A1 = (1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(d/1000)
A2 = (1.30)/(A1)
A3 = (0.8)*(A1)
