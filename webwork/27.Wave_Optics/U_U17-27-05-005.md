## Question Section 

Find the wavelength of light that has its third minimum at an angle of(angle^circ) when it falls on a single slit of width(dtimes 10^-6,(m) .
## C
when it falls on a single slit of width(dtimes 10^-6,(m) .
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1,7,0.01)
angle = randrange(15,75,0.1)
A1 = (d*(10**(-6)))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))/(3)*(10**(9))
