## Question Section 

Calculate the angle for the third-order maximum of(wave,(nm) wavelength yellow light falling on double slits separated by(slit,(mm).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(400,700,0.1)
slit = randrange(0.01,0.5,0.001)
A1 = asin(((3)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(slit*(10**(-3)))))*(180/pi)
