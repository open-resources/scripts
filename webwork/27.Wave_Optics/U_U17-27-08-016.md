## Question Section 

Suppose you put on two pairs of Polaroid sunglasses with their axes at an angle of(angle^circ) . How much longer will it take the light to deposit a given amount of energy in your eye compared with a single pair of sunglasses? Assume the lenses are clear except for their polarizing characteristics.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(10,40,0.1)

A1 = (1)/((cos((angle)*(pi/180)))**(2))
