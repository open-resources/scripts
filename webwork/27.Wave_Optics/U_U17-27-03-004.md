## Question Section 

Find the distance between two slits that produces the first minimum for(wave,(nm) light at an angle of(angle^circ).


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(390,600,0.1)
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
A1 = (1/2)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))
