## Question Section 

An electric current through hydrogen gas produces several distinct wavelengths of visible light. What are the wavelengths of the hydrogen spectrum, if they form first-order maxima at angles of (a1) ,(a2)  ,(a3)  , and(a4) degrees when projected on a diffraction grating having(5,000) lines per centimeter? 
From smallest wavelength to greatest:


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a1 = randrange(23,25,0.1)
a2 = randrange(25.1,28,0.1)
a3 = randrange(28.1,31,0.1)
a4 = randrange(31.1,35,0.1)
d = (0.01)/(5000)
A1 = (d)*(sin((a1)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
A2 = (d)*(sin((a2)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
A3 = (d)*(sin((a3)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
A4 = (d)*(sin((a4)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
