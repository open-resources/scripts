## Question Section 

What is the wavelength of light falling on double slits separated by(slittimes 10^-6,(m) if the third-order maximum is at an angle of(angle^circ)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,75,0.1)
slit = randrange(1,9,0.01)
A1 = (slit)*(10**(-6))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))/(3)
