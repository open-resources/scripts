## Question Section 

An aircraft maintenance technician walks past a tall hangar door that acts like a single slit for sound entering the hangar. Outside the door, on a line perpendicular to the opening in the door, a jet engine makes a(freq,(Hz) sound. At what angle with the door will the technician observe the first minimum in sound intensity if the vertical opening is(width,(m) wide and the speed of sound is(340,(ms)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
width = randrange(0.7,1,0.01)
freq = randrange(550,700,0.1)
A1 = asin(((340)/(freq))/(width))*(180/pi)
