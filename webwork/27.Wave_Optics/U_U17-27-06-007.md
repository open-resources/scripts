## Question Section 

What is the minimum diameter mirror on a telescope that would allow you to see details as small as(d) km on the Moon some(384,000,(km) away? Assume an average wavelength of(wave,(nm) for the light received.
## D
km on the Moon some(384,000,(km) away? Assume an average wavelength of(wave,(nm) for the light received.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(3,9,0.01)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))*(384000)*(100)/(d)
