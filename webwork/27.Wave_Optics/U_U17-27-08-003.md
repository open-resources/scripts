## Question Section 

If you have completely polarized light of intensity(intensity,(Wm^2) , what will its intensity be after passing through a polarizing filter with its axis at an angle of(angle^circ) to the light's polarization direction?
## C
to the light's polarization direction?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(70,90,0.1)
intensity = randrange(100,200,0.1)
A1 = (intensity)*((cos((angle)*(pi/180)))**(2))
