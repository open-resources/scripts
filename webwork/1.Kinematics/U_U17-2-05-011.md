## Question Section 

A fireworks shell is accelerated from rest to a velocity of(velocity,(ms) over a distance of(d,(m).
a) How long did the acceleration last?
b) Calculate the acceleration.
## A
How long did the acceleration last?
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate the acceleration.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
velocity = randrange(50,80,0.1)
d = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.01)
A1 = 2*(d)/(velocity)
A2 = ((velocity)**(2))/((2)*(d))
