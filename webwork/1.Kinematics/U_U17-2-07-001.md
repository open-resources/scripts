## Question Section 

Calculate the displacement and velocity at time(t,(s) for a ball thrown straight up with an initial velocity of(v,(ms).
Displacement =
Velocity =


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(1,4,0.01)
v = randrange(12,20,0.1)
A1 = (v)*(t)+(0.5)*(-9.8)*((t)**(2))
A2 = (v)+(-9.8)*(t)
