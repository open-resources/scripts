## Question Section 

<b>
You can determine the index of refraction of a substance by determining its critical angle.
a) What is the index of refraction of a substance that has a critical angle of(critical_angle_water_degrees^circ) when submerged in water? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1
n_water = 1.333
critical_angle_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,60,0.1))
critical_angle_water_rads = critical_angle_water_degrees*(pi/180)

n_unknown = (n_water)/sin(critical_angle_water_rads)
critical_angle_air_rads = asin(n_air/n_unknown)
critical_angle_air_degrees = critical_angle_air_rads*(180/pi)
