## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have an unknown clear substance immersed in water, and you wish to identify it by finding its index of refraction. You arrange to have a beam of light enter it at an angle of (theta_water_degrees^circ), and you observe the angle of refraction to be(theta_unknown_degrees^circ). What is the index of refraction of the substance? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_water = 1.333
theta_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,0.1))
theta_water_rads = theta_water_degrees*(pi/180)
theta_unknown_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,35,0.1))
theta_unknown_rads = theta_unknown_degrees*(pi/180)

n_unknown = (n_water)*(sin(theta_water_rads)/sin(theta_unknown_rads))
