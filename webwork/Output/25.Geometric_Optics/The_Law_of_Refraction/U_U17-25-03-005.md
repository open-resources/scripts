## Question Section 

<b>
There was a major collision of an asteroid with the Moon in medieval times. It was described by monks at Canterbury Cathedral in England as a red glow on and around the Moon. How long after the asteroid hit the Moon, which is(moon_distancetimes 10^5)(km)  away, would the light first arrive on Earth?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

c = 3*10**8
moon_distance = sprintf("%0.3f", 3.844)
moon_distanceSI = moon_distance*10**8

timeSI = (moon_distanceSI)/(c)
