![Ray Diagram]("NU_U17-25-03-011.png")

<b>
Suppose the figure above represents a ray of light going from air through crown glass into water, such as going into a fish tank. Calculate the amount the ray is displaced by the glass, <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";><i>&Delta;x<i><span>, given that the incident angle is(theta_1_degrees^circ) and the glass is(thickness)(cm) thick. Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to(n_glass).
ans_rule(40)(mm)

## C
and the glass is(thickness)(cm) thick. Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to(n_glass).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1
n_glass = 1.52
thickness = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.1,0.01))
theta_1_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(40,45,0.1))
theta_1_rads = theta_1_degrees*(pi/180)

theta_2_rads = asin(((n_air/n_glass)*sin(theta_1_rads)))
delta_x = thickness*(tan(theta_1_rads)-tan(theta_2_rads))
delta_x_mm = delta_x*10
