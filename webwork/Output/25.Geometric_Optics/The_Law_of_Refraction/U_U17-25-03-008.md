## Question Section 

![Ray Diagram]("NU_U17-25-03-008.png")

<b>
a) Given that the angle between the ray in the water and the perpendicular to the water is(theta_water_degrees^circ), and using information in the figure above, find the height of the instructor's head above the water. Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).

## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1
n_water = 1.333
theta_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
theta_water_rads = theta_water_degrees*(pi/180)

theta_air_rads = asin((n_water/n_air)*sin(theta_water_rads))
theta_instructor_rads = (pi/2)-theta_air_rads

height_instructorSI = 2*tan(theta_instructor_rads)
depth_diverSI = 2*tan(theta_water_rads)/tan(theta_air_rads)
