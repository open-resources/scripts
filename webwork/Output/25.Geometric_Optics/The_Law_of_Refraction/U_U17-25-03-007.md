## Question Section 

<b>
Components of some computers communicate with each other through optical fibers having an index of refraction(n). What time is required for a signal to travel(distanceSI)(m) through such a fiber?
ans_rule(40)(ns)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
c = 3*10**8
n = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.4,1.6,0.01))
distanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.1,0.3,0.001))

timeSI = (n*distanceSI)/(c)
time = timeSI*10**9
