## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Light traveling from water to a gemstone strikes the surface at an angle of (theta_water_degrees^circ)  and has an angle of refraction of(theta_gemstone_degrees^circ). What is the speed of light in the gemstone? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).
ans_rule(40)

## C
 and has an angle of refraction of(theta_gemstone_degrees^circ). What is the speed of light in the gemstone? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
c = 3*10**8
n_water = 1.333
theta_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(85,90,0.1))
theta_water_rads = theta_water_degrees*(pi/180)
theta_gemstone_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
theta_gemstone_rads = theta_gemstone_degrees*(pi/180)

speed_gemstoneSI = (c/n_water)*(sin(theta_gemstone_rads)/sin(theta_water_rads))
