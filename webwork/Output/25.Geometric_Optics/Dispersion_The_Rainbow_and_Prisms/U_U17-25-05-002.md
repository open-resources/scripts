## Question Section 

<b>
A beam of white light goes from air into water at an incident angle of(theta_incident_degrees^circ). At what angles are the red(660)(nm) and violet(410)(nm) parts of the light refracted? Red light in water has an index of refraction equal to(n_red) and that of violet light is(n_violet).
Red =ans_rule(40) &#176;
Violet =ans_rule(40) &#176;

## D
and that of violet light is(n_violet).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1
n_red = 1.331
n_violet = 1.342
theta_incident_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(80,85,0.1))
theta_incident_rads = theta_incident_degrees*(pi/180)

theta_red_rads = asin((n_air*sin(theta_incident_rads))/n_red)
theta_red_degrees = theta_red_rads*(180/pi)
theta_violet_rads = asin((n_air*sin(theta_incident_rads))/n_violet)
theta_violet_degrees = theta_violet_rads*(180/pi)
