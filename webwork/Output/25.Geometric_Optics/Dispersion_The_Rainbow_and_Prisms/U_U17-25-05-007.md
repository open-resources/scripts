## Question Section 

<b>
A narrow beam of light containing(660)(nm) red and(470)(nm) blue wavelengths travels from air through a(thickness)(cm) thick flat piece of crown glass and back to air again. The beam strikes at a(theta_incident_degrees^circ) incident angle. The index of refraction in crown glass for red light is(n_red) and for blue light is(n_blue).
a) At what angles do the two colors emerge?
Red =ans_rule(40) &#176;
Blue =ans_rule(40) &#176;

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_blue = 1.524
n_red  =1.512
thickness = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.1,0.01))
thicknessSI = thickness*10**-2
theta_incident_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(65,70,0.1))
theta_incident_rads = theta_incident_degrees*(pi/180)

theta_blue_rads = asin(sin(theta_incident_rads)/n_blue)
theta_blue_degrees = theta_blue_rads*(180/pi)
theta_red_rads = asin(sin(theta_incident_rads)/n_red)
theta_red_degrees = theta_red_rads*(180/pi)

delta_xSI = (thicknessSI)*abs(tan(theta_red_rads)-tan(theta_blue_rads))
