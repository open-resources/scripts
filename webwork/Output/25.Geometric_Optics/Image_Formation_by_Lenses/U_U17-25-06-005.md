## Question Section 

<b>
How far from the lens must the film in a camera be, if the lens has a(focal_length)(mm) focal length and is being used to photograph a flower(object_distance)(cm) away? 
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
object_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(40,45,0.1))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

image_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*object_distanceSI)/(object_distanceSI-focal_length)
