## Question Section 

<b>
What is the power in diopters of a camera lens that has a(focal_length)(mm) focal length?
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(75,80,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3

focal_power = focal_lengthSI**-1
