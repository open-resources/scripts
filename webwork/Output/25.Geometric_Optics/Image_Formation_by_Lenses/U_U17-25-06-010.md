## Question Section 

<b>
A camera lens used for taking close-up photographs has a focal length of(focal_length)(mm). The farthest it can be placed from the film is(image_distance)(mm).
a) What is the closest object that can be photographed?
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
What is the closest object that can be photographed?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,20,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
image_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,35,0.1))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-3

object_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = -(image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
