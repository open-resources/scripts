## Question Section 

<b>
A camera with a(focal_length)(mm) focal length lens is used to photograph the sun and moon. What is the height of the image of the sun on the film, given the sun is(object_heighttimes 10^6)(km) in diameter and is(object_distancetimes 10^6)(km) away?
ans_rule(40)(mm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(180,190,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
object_distance = 149.6
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**9
object_height = 1.391
object_heightSI = object_height*10**9

magnification = (1-(object_distanceSI/focal_lengthSI))**-1
image_heightSI = (object_heightSI*magnification)
image_height = image_heightSI*10**3
