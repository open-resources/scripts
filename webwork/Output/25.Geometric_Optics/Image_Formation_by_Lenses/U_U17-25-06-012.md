## A
What is the focal length of a magnifying glass that produces a magnification of(magnification) when held(object_distance)(cm) from an object, such as a rare coin?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
magnification = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3,0.01))
object_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.5,6,0.01))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

image_distanceSI = (-magnification*object_distanceSI)
focal_lengthSI = (image_distanceSI*object_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI+object_distanceSI)
focal_length = focal_lengthSI*10**-2

focal_power = focal_lengthSI**-1
