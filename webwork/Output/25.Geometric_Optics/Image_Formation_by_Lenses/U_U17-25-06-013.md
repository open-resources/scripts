## Question Section 

<b>
What magnification will be produced by a lens of power(focal_power)(D) if an object is held(object_distance)(cm) away?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
object_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2
focal_power = -sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,4.5,0.01))

magnification = (1-focal_power*object_distanceSI)**-1
