## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose your(focal_length)(mm) focal length camera lens is(image_distance)(mm) away from the film in the camera.
a) How far away is an object that is in focus? 
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
How far away is an object that is in focus? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
image_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(55,60,0.1))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-3
image_height = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3,0.01))
image_heightSI = image_height*10**-2

object_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = -(image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
object_heightSI = (-image_heightSI*magnification)
