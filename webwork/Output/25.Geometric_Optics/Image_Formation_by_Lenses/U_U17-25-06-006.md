## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(100,101,0.01))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
object_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(102,103,0.01))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-3

slide_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,25,0.1))
slide_length_cm = slide_length*10**-1
slide_width = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,40,0.1))
slide_width_cm = slide_width*10**-1

image_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*object_distanceSI)/(object_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
abs_magnification = (image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)

new_length_cm = (abs_magnification*slide_length_cm)
new_width_cm = (abs_magnification*slide_width_cm)
