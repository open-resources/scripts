## Question Section 

<b>
Your camera's zoom lens has an adjustable focal length ranging from(focal_length_min)(mm) to(focal_length_max)(mm). What is its range of powers?
Minimum:ans_rule(20)(D)
Maximum:ans_rule(20)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length_min = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
focal_length_minSI = focal_length_min*10**-3
focal_length_max = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(100,105,0.1))
focal_length_maxSI = focal_length_max*10**-3

focal_power_min = focal_length_maxSI**-1
focal_power_max = focal_length_minSI**-1
