## A
Calculate the focal length of the mirror formed by the shiny back of a spoon that has a(radius_of_curvature)(cm) radius of curvature. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
radius_of_curvature = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))

radius_of_curavtureSI = radius_of_curvature*10**-2
focal_lengthSI = -radius_of_curavtureSI/2
focal_power = focal_lengthSI**-1
