## Question Section 

<b>
A shopper standing(object_distanceSI)(m) from a convex security mirror sees his image with a magnification of(magnification).
a) Where is his image?
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
Where is his image?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
magnification = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
object_distanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.5,0.01))

image_distanceSI = (-magnification*object_distanceSI)
focal_lengthSI = (object_distanceSI)/(1-magnification**-1)
radius_of_curvatureSI = 2*(focal_lengthSI)
