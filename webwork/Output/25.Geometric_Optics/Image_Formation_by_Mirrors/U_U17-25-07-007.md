## Question Section 

<b>
An object(object_height)(cm) high is held(object_distanceSI)(m) from a person's cornea, and its reflected image is measured to be(image_height)(cm) high.
a) What is the magnification? 
ans_rule(40)

## A
What is the magnification? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
image_height = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.1,0.3,0.01))
image_heightSI = image_height*10**-2
object_height = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.01))
object_heightSI = object_height*10**-2
object_distanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.5,5,0.01))

magnification = (image_heightSI)/(object_heightSI)
image_distanceSI = (-magnification*object_distanceSI)
focal_lengthSI = (object_distanceSI)/(1-magnification**-1)
radius_of_curvatureSI = 2*focal_lengthSI
