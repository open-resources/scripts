## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> Calculate the intensity of infrared radiation projected by the concave mirror of an electric heater on a person(image_distanceSI)(m) away. Assume that the mirror has a radius of curvature of(radius_of_curvature)(cm), the heating element radiates(powerSI)(W) and has an area of(surface_area_1)(cm^2), and that half of the radiated power is reflected and focused by the mirror.
ans_rule(40)(Wm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
image_distanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(3,5,0.1))
surface_area_1 = randrange(100,120,1)
surface_area_1SI = surface_area_1*10**-4
powerSI = randrange(1000,1500,50)
power_reflectedSI = powerSI/2
radius_of_curvature = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,55,0.1))
radius_of_curvatureSI = radius_of_curvature*10**-2

focal_lengthSI = (radius_of_curvatureSI)/2
object_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = -(image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
surface_area_2SI = abs(magnification*surface_area_1SI)
intensity_2SI = (power_reflectedSI)/(surface_area_2SI)
