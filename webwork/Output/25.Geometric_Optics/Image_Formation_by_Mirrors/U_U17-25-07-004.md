## Question Section 

<b>
An electric room heater uses a concave mirror to reflect infrared radiation from hot coils. Note that IR follows the same law of reflection as visible light. Find its magnification, given that the mirror has a radius of curvature of(radius_of_curvature)(cm) and produces an image of the coils(image_distanceSI)(m) away from the mirror.
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
radius_of_curvature = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,60,0.1))
radius_of_curvatureSI = radius_of_curvature*10**-2
image_distanceSI =  sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(3,4,0.1))

focal_lengthSI = radius_of_curvatureSI/2
magnification = 1-(image_distanceSI/focal_lengthSI)
