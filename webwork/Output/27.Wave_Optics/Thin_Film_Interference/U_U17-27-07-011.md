## Question Section 

Two(long,(cm) long glass slides are illuminated by pure(wave,(nm) wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on some debris at the other end, forming a wedge of air. How thick is the debris, if the dark bands are(1.00,(mm) apart?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
long = randrange(5,10,0.01)
A1 = (long/100)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(10**(-3))
