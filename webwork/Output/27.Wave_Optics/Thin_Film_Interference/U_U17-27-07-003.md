## Question Section 

Calculate the minimum thickness of an oil slick on water that appears blue when illuminated by white light perpendicular to its surface. Take the wavelength to be(wave,(nm) and the index of refraction of oil to be(1.40).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (wave*(10**(-9)))/((4)*(1.4))
