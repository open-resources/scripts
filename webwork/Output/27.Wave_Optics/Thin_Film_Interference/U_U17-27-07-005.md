## Question Section 

A film of soapy water ((n) =(1.33) ) on top of a plastic cutting board has a thickness of(thick,(nm). What wavelength is most strongly reflected if it is illuminated perpendicular to its surface?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
thick = randrange(100,400,0.1)

A1 = (2)*(thick)*(1.33)
