## Question Section 

What are the three smallest non-zero thicknesses of soapy water ((n) =(1.33) ) on Plexiglas if it appears as(wave,(nm) wavelength light when illuminated perpendicularly by white light?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (wave)/((2)*(1.33))
A2 = (wave)/((1)*(1.33))
A3 = (3)*(wave)/((2)*(1.33))
