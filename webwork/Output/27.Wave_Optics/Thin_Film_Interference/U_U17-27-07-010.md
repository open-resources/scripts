## Question Section 

In a lab, two glass slides are illuminated by pure-wavelength light incident perpendicularly. The top slide touches the bottom slide at one end and rests on a(d,(mm) diameter hair at the other end, forming a wedge of air. How far apart are the dark bands, if the slides are(long,(cm) long and(wave,(nm) light is used?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.05,0.2,0.0001)
long = randrange(5,10,0.01)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
A1 = (wave*(10**(-9)))/(tan((atan((d/1000)*(pi/180))/(long/100))*(180/pi)))
