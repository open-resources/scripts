## Question Section 

An oil slick on water is(thick,(nm) thick and illuminated by white light incident perpendicular to its surface. What color does the oil appear (what is the most constructively reflected wavelength), given its index of refraction is(1.40)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
thick = randrange(50,180,0.1)

A1 = (4)*(thick*(10**(-9)))*(1.40)
