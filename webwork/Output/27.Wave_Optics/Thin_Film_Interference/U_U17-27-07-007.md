## Question Section 

Suppose you have a lens system that is to be used primarily for(wave,(nm) light. What is the second thinnest coating of fluorite (magnesium fluoride) ((n) =(1.38) ) that would be non-reflective for this wavelength?

## E
((n) =(1.38) ) that would be non-reflective for this wavelength?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (3)*(wave)/((4)*(1.38))
