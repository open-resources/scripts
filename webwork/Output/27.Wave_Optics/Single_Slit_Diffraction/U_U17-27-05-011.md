b) What is the angle of the third-order minimum?

## A
If a single slit produces a first minimum at(angle^circ), at what angle is the second-order minimum? 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the angle of the third-order minimum?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(1,15,0.1)

A1 = asin((2)*(sin((angle)*(pi/180))))*(180/pi)
A2 = asin((3)*(sin((angle)*(pi/180))))*(180/pi)
