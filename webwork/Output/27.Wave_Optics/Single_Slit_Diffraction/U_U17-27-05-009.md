## Question Section 

a) Find the angle between the first minima for the two sodium vapor lines, which have wavelengths of(wave) and(wave2(nm), when they fall upon a single slit of width(widthtimes 10^-6,(m).
b) What is the distance between these minima if the diffraction pattern falls on a screen(d,(m) from the slit?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.5,3,0.01)
wave = randrange(500,550,0.1)
wave2 = randrange(550,600,0.1)
width = randrange(0.5,5,0.01)
A1 = (asin(wave2*(10**(-9))/(width*(10**(-6))))*(180/pi))-(asin((wave*(10**(-9)))/(width*(10**(-6))))*(180/pi))
A2 = (d)*(tan((A1)*(pi/180)))
