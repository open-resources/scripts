## Question Section 

A water break at the entrance to a harbor consists of a rock barrier with a(width,m) wide opening. Ocean waves of(wave,m) wavelength approach the opening straight on. At what angle to the incident direction are the boats inside the harbor most protected against wave action?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
do {
wave = randrange(20,30,0.1)
width = randrange(50,65,0.1)
} until (abs((2)*(wave)/(width)) < 1)
A1 = asin((2)*(wave)/(width))*(180/pi)
