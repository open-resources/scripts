## Question Section 

a) Light averaging(wave,(nm) in wavelength falls on a single slit of width(slittimes 10^-6,(m). At what angle does it produces its second minimum? 
b) What is the highest-order minimum produced?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
slit = randrange(3,9,0.01)
A1 = asin((2)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(slit*(10**(-6))))*(180/pi)
A2 = (slit*(10**(-6)))/(wave*(10**(-9)))
