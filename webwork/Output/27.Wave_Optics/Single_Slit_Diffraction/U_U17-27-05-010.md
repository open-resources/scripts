## Question Section 

(a) What is the minimum width of a single slit (in multiples of(lambda)) that will produce a first minimum for a wavelength(lambda)? Enter(lambda) as(y)
(D)=ans_rule(40)
(b) What is its minimum width if it produces(50) minima? 
(D) =ans_rule(40)
(c)(1000) minima?
(D) =ans_rule(40)
