## Question Section 

On a day when the intensity of sunlight is(1.00,(kWm^2), a circular lens(d,(m) in diameter focuses light onto water in a black beaker. Two polarizing sheets of plastic are placed in front of the lens with their axes at an angle of(angle^circ). Assuming the sunlight is unpolarized and the polarizers are(100,(%)  efficient, what is the initial rate of heating of the water in(^circCs) , assuming it is(80,(%)  absorbed? The aluminum beaker has a mass of(mass) grams and contains(volume) grams of water.

## E
grams of water.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.1,0.3,0.001)
angle = randrange(10,40,0.1)
mass = randrange(200,400,0.1)
volume = randrange(200,300,0.1)
a1 = (cos((angle)*(pi/180)))**(2)*(1000)
a2 = (a1)*(pi)*((d/2)**(2))
a3 = (0.8)*(a2)
den = (volume/1000)*(4186)+(mass/1000)*(900)
A1 = (a3)/(den)
