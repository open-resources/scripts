## Question Section 

The intensity of polarized light is reduced to(90.0,(%) of its original value by passing through a polarizing filter with its axis at an angle of (18.4^circ) to the direction of polarization. Verify this statement.
Enter the equivalence statement. If you need to raise(cos)(theta) to an exponent, put the entire term in parentheses. Enter angle(theta) as "(x)".
(I)(I)<sub>o<sub> =ans_rule(40)
Now substitute an angle of(18.4^circ) into the expression above (recall that WebWorks evaluates in radians);
ans_rule(40)
Express this value as a percent with two significant figures;

## A
to an exponent, put the entire term in parentheses. Enter angle(thetas "(x)".
### Answer Section
## C
to the direction of polarization. Verify this statement.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

B= (cos(18.4*pi/180))**2
C= 90
