## Question Section 

What angle would the axis of a polarizing filter need to make with the direction of polarized light of intensity(intensity,(kWm^2) to reduce the intensity to(intensity2,(Wm^2)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
intensity = randrange(0.5,2,0.01)
intensity2 = randrange(5,15,0.1)

A1 = acos(((intensity2)/(intensity*(10**(3))))**(1/2))*(180/pi)
