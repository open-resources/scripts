## Question Section 

Show that if you have three polarizing filters, with the second at an angle of(45^circ) to the first and the third at an angle of(90^circ) to the first, the intensity of light passed by the first will be reduced to(25,(%) of its value. (This is in contrast to having only the first and third, which reduces the intensity to zero, so that placing the second between them increases the intensity of the transmitted light.)
First, write expressions for(I)<sub>1<sub> and(I)<sub>2<sub>. Enter(I)<sub>0<sub> as(I), enter(I)<sub>1<sub> as(i). Enter(theta) as(x) for the first angle, and as(y) for the second angle. If(cos(x)) must be raised to an exponent, enclose the entire expression in parentheses. At the moment, you are only entering formulas, do not substitute values.
(I)<sub>1<sub> =ans_rule(40)
(I)<sub>2<sub> =ans_rule(40)
Combine the two above expressions;
(I)<sub>2<sub> =ans_rule(40)
Now substitute values into the equation above;
(I)<sub>2<sub> =ans_rule(40)

## A
as(x) for the first angle, and as(y) for the second angle. If(cos(x)) must be raised to an exponent, enclose the entire expression in parentheses. At the moment, you are only entering formulas, do not substitute values.

## C
to the first and the third at an angle of(90^cirto the first, the intensity of light passed by the first will be reduced to(25,(%) of its value. (This is in contrast to having only the first and third, which reduces the intensity to zero, so that placing the second between them increases the intensity of the transmitted light.)
