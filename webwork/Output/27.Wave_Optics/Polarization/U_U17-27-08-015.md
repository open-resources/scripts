## Question Section 

If a polarizing filter reduces the intensity of polarized light to(percent)(%) of its original value, by how much are the electric and magnetic fields reduced?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(30,80,0.1)

A1 = (percent/100)**(1/2)
