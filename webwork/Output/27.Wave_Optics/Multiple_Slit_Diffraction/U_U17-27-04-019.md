## Question Section 

What is the distance between fringes produced by a diffraction grating having(lines) lines per centimeter for(wave,(nm) light, if the screen is(d,(m) away?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1,2,0.01)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
lines = randrange(50,300,1)
A1 = (d)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/((0.01)/(lines))
