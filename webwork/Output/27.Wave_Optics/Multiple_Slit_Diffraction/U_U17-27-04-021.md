## Question Section 

What visible wavelength has its fourth-order maximum at an angle of(angle) degrees  when projected on a(25,000) line per centimeter diffraction grating?

## E
degrees  when projected on a(25,000) line per centimeter diffraction grating?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)

A1 = ((1)/((25000)*(100)))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))/(4)*(10**(9))
