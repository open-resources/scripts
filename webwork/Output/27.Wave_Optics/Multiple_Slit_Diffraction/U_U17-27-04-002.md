## Question Section 

Find the angle for the third-order maximum for(wave,(nm) wavelength light falling on a diffraction grating having(lines) lines per centimeter.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
lines = randrange(1500,3000,1)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = asin((3*wave*(10**(-9)))/((0.01)/(lines)))*(180/pi)
