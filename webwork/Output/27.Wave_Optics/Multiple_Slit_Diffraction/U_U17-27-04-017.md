## Question Section 

(a) Show that a(30,000)-line-per-centimeter grating will not produce a maximum for visible light.
Slit separation =
Longest wavelength =
(b) What is the longest wavelength for which it does produce a first-order maximum? 
(c) What is the greatest number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a complete second-order spectrum for visible light? (The longest wavelength of visible light is(760,(nm)).

### Answer Section
## C
What is the greatest number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a complete second-order spectrum for visible light? (The longest wavelength of visible light is(760,(nm)).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

A = 1/30000*1/100*10**9
d = 2*760*10**(-9)
N = 1/(d)*1/100
