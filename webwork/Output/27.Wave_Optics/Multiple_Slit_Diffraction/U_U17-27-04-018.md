## Question Section 

A He–Ne laser beam is reflected from the surface of a CD onto a wall. The brightest spot is the reflected beam at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. However, fringes are also observed. If the wall is(d,(m) from the CD, and the first fringe is(fringe,(m) from the central maximum, what is the spacing of grooves on the CD? The He-Ne laser has a wavelength of(633,(nm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
fringe = randrange(0.3,1,0.001)
d = randrange(1,2,0.01)
A1 = (6.33*(10**(-7)))/((fringe)/(d))
