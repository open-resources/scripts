## Question Section 

Structures on a bird feather act like a reflection grating having(lines) lines per centimeter. What is the angle of the first-order maximum for(wave,(nm) light?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
lines = randrange(5000,10000,1)
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
A1 = asin((1)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(0.01/lines))*(180/pi)
