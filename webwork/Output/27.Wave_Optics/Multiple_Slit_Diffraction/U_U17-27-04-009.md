## Question Section 

The light from a sodium vapor lamp seems to be of pure wavelength, but it produces two first-order maxima at(angle^circ) and(angle2^circ)  when projected on a(10,000) line per centimeter diffraction grating. What are the two wavelengths?

## C
and(angle2^cir when projected on a(10,000) line per centimeter diffraction grating. What are the two wavelengths?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(30,35,0.001)
angle2 = randrange(35,40,0.001)
A1 = (0.01/10000)*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
A2 = (0.01/10000)*(sin((angle2)*(pi/180)))*(10**(9))
