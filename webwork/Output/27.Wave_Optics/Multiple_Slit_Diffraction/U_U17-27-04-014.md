## Question Section 

Show that a diffraction grating cannot produce a second-order maximum for a given wavelength of light unless the first-order maximum is at an angle less than(30.0^circ). 
If(dsin)(theta)<sub>1<sub> =(lambda) and if(dsin)(theta)<sub>2<sub> =(2)(lambda), solve this question by finding an <i>simplified expression<i> for(theta)<sub>1<sub>. Use "asin" for inverse sine.
 
(theta)<sub>1<sub> =ans_rule(40)

## A
and if(dsin)(theta)<sub>2<sub> =(2)(lambda), solve this question by finding an <i>simplified expression<i> for(theta)<sub>1<sub>. Use "asin" for inverse sine.
