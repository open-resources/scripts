## Question Section 

What is the spacing between structures in a feather that acts as a reflection grating, given that they produce a first-order maximum for(wave,(nm) light at a(angle^circ)  angle?

## C
 angle?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
A1 = (1)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))
