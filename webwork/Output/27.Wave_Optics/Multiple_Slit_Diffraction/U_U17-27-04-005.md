## Question Section 

Calculate the wavelength of light that has its second-order maximum at(angle^circ) when falling on a diffraction grating that has(lines) lines per centimeter.

## C
when falling on a diffraction grating that has(lines) lines per centimeter.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(30,60,0.1)
lines = randrange(4000,6000,1)
A1 = ((1)/((lines)*(100)))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))/(2)
