## Question Section 

If a diffraction grating produces a first-order maximum for the shortest wavelength of visible light at(angle), at what angle will the first-order maximum be for the longest wavelength of visible light? The range of visible light is(380,(nm) to(760,(nm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(1,30,0.1)
b = (380*(10**(-9)))/(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))
A1 = asin((760*(10**(-9)))/(b))*(180/pi)
