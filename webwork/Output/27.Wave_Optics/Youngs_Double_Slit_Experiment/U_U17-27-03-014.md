## Question Section 

Calculate the distance between fringes for(wave,(nm) light falling on double slits separated by(d,(mm), located(d2,(m) from a screen.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)
d = randrange(0.01,0.09,0.0001)
d2 = randrange(2,4,0.01)
A1 = (d2)*(wave*(10**(-7)))/(d/1000)
