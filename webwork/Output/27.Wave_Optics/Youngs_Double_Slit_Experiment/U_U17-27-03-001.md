## Question Section 

At what angle is the first-order maximum for(wavelength,(nm) wavelength blue light falling on double slits separated by(slittimes 10^-5,(m)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength = randrange(380,760,0.1)
slit = randrange(1,9,0.1)

A1 = asin((1)*(wavelength*(10**(-9)))/((slit)*(10**(-5))))*(180/pi)
