## Question Section 

Calculate the wavelength of light that has its third minimum at an angle of(angle^circ) when falling on double slits separated by(slittimes 10^-6,(m).

## C
when falling on double slits separated by(slittimes 10^-6,(m).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,60,0.1)
slit = randrange(1,9,0.01)

A1 = (slit)*(10**(-6))*(sin((angle)*(pi/180)))/(2.5)
