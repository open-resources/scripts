## Question Section 

Find the wavelength of light that produces fringes(d,(m) apart on a screen(d2,(m) from double slits separated by(slit,(mm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
slit = randrange(0.1,0.2,0.001)
d = randrange(0.001,0.009,0.00001)
d2 = randrange(2,4,0.01)
A1 = (slit/1000)*(d)/(d2)
