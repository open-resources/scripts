## Question Section 

What is the ratio of thicknesses of crown glass and water that would contain the same number of wavelengths of light? Crown glass has an index of refraction equal to(1.52) and water has an index of refraction equal to(1.333).
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

A1 = (1.333)/(1.52)
