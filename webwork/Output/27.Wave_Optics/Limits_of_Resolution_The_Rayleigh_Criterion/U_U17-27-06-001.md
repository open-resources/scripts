## Question Section 

The(300,(m) diameter Arecibo radio telescope detects radio waves with a(wave,(cm) average wavelength.
a) What is the angle between two just-resolvable point sources for this telescope?
b) How close together could these point sources be at the(ly) million light year distance of the Andromeda galaxy?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(3,5,0.01)
ly = randrange(1,4,0.01)
A1 = (1.22)*(wave/100)/(300)
A2 = (ly*1000000)*(A1)
