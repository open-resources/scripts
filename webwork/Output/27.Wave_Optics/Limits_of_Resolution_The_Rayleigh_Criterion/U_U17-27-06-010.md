## Question Section 

The headlights of a car are(d,(m) apart. What is the maximum distance at which the eye can resolve these two headlights? Take the pupil diameter to be(d2,(cm). Use a wavelength of(555,(nm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1,1.5,0.01)
d2 = randrange(0.3,0.7,0.01)

A1 = (d)*(d2/100)/((1.22)*(555*(10**(-9))))/1000
