## Question Section 

An amateur astronomer wants to build a telescope with a diffraction limit that will allow him to see if there are people on the moons of Jupiter. What diameter mirror is needed to be able to see(1.00,(m) detail on a Jovian Moon at a distance of(7.50times 10^8,(km) from Earth? The wavelength of light averages(wave,(nm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/((1)/(7.50*(10**(11))))/1000
