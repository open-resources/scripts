## Question Section 

Use the angular resolution for the Hubble Telescope to determine the smallest detail which it can observe on the moon, if the moon is(3.82times 10^8,(m) away. Assume an average wavelength of(500,(nm), and that the telescope's diameter is(2.40)(m).



## Answer Section

A1 = (3.82*(10**(8))*1.22*550*(10**(-9)))/2.4
