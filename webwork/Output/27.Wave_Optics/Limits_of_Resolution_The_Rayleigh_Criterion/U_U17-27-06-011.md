## Question Section 

When dots are placed on a page from a laser printer, they must be close enough so that you do not see the individual dots of ink. To do this, the separation of the dots must be less than Raleigh's criterion. Take the pupil of the eye to be(d,(mm) and the distance from the paper to the eye of(d2,(cm); find the minimum separation of two dots such that they cannot be resolved. Take the wavelength to be( 500,(nm).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(2,4,0.01)
d2 = randrange(20,40,0.1)
A1 = (1.22)*(555*(10**(-9)))/(d/1000)*(d2/100)*100
