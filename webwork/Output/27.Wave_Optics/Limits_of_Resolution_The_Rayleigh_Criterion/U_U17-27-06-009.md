## Question Section 

The planet Pluto and its Moon Charon are separated by(19,600,(km). Neglecting atmospheric effects, at what distance will the(5.08,(m) diameter Mount Palomar telescope be able to resolve these bodies when they are(4.50times 10^9,(km) from Earth? Assume an average wavelength of(wave,(nm). 
The telescope should be able to discern a separation at :.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wave = randrange(380,760,0.1)

A1 = (4.50*(10**(9)))*((1.22)*(wave*(10**(-9)))/(5.08))
