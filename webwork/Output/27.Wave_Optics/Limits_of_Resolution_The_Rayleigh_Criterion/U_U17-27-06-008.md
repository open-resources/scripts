## Question Section 

You are told not to shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. If the eyes are separated by(d2,(cm) and the diameter of your pupil is(d,(mm), at what distance can you resolve the two eyes using light of wavelength(555,(nm)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d= randrange(4,6,0.01)
d2= randrange(5,9,0.1)
A1 = (d/100)*(d2/1000)/((1.22)*(555*(10**(-9))))
