## Question Section 

A section of superconducting wire carries a current of(Intensity) A and requires(1.00) L of liquid nitrogen per hour to keep it below its critical temperature. For it to be
economically advantageous to use a superconducting wire, the cost of cooling the
wire must be less than the cost of energy lost to heat in the wire. Assume that the cost
of liquid nitrogen is (costnitrogen) per litre, and that electric energy costs (costelectric) per kW·h. 
What is the resistance of a normal wire that costs as much in wasted electric energy as the cost of liquid nitrogen for the superconductor?
ans_rule(40)(Omega)

## C
per kW·h.
