## Question Section 

a) What Hubble constant corresponds to an approximate age of the universe of(10^10) y? To get an approximate value, assume the expansion rate is constant and calculate the speed at which two galaxies must move apart to be separated by(1) Mly (present average galactic separation) in a time of(10^10) y. 
ans_rule(40) kms . Mly
