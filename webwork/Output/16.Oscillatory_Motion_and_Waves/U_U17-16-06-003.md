## Question Section 

<b>
At which positions is the speed of a simple harmonic oscillator half its maximum speed? That is, which values of(xX) give(v =pm v_max  2), where(X) is the amplitude of the motion?
(xX =pm)ans_rule(30)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 

A1 = sqrt(3)/2
