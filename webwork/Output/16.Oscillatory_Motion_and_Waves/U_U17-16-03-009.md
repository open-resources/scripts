<b>
A(mass1)-(kg) skydiver hanging from a parachute bounces up and down with a period of(T)(s). What is the new period of oscillation when a second skydiver, whose mass is(mass2)(kg), hangs from the legs of the first?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass1 = randrange(80.00,100.00,0.1) 
mass2 = randrange(60.00,80.00,0.1) 
T = randrange(1,2,0.01)

A1 = (T)*(((mass1)+(mass2))/(mass1))**(1/2)
