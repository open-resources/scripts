## Question Section 

a) A spring that has stiffness constant(224) Nm rests at its equilibrium length of(14) cm. You gently pull on the end of the spring, stretching it to a length of(16) cm, where you hold the spring at rest. Determine the magnitude of the force that you need to hold the spring at its new length.
