## Question Section 

<b>
What is the wavelength of an earthquake that shakes you with a frequency of(freq)(Hz) and gets to another city(distance)(km) away in(time)(s)?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(8,20,1)
freq = randrange(5,20,0.1)
distance = randrange(70,99,0.1)

A1 = ((distance)*(10)**(3))/((time)*(freq))
