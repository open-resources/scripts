## Question Section 

<b>
Storms in the South Pacific can create waves that travel all the way to the California coast, which are(12,000)(km) away. How long does it take them if they travel at(speed)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(10,20,0.1)

A1 = (12000000)/(speed)
