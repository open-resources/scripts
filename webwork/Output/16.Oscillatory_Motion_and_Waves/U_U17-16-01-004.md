## Question Section 

<b>
The springs of a pickup truck act like a single spring with a force constant of(constanttimes 10^5)(Nm).
a)  By how much will the truck be depressed by its maximum load of(mass)(kg)? 
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
 By how much will the truck be depressed by its maximum load of(mass)(kg)? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(900,1100,10) 
constant = randrange(1.2,1.4,0.01)
v = randrange(17,23,0.1)
A1 = (mass)*(9.80)/((constant)*(10**5))
A2 = (mass)*(9.80)/(4*(A1))
