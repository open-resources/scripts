## Question Section 

<b>
Fish are hung on a spring scale to determine their mass.
a)  What is the force constant of the spring in such a scale if it the spring stretches(x)(cm) for a(mass)(kg) load?
b) What is the mass of a fish that stretches the spring(x2)(cm)?
c) How far apart are the half-kilogram marks on the scale?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 
x = randrange(5,10,0.17)  
A1 = (mass)*(9.80)/(x/100)
x2 = randrange(5,10,0.1)
A2 = (A1)*(x2/100)/(9.8)
A3 = 1000*(0.5)*(9.8)/(A1)
