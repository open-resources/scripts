## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose the length of a clock's pendulum is changed by an increase of(1.000)(%), exactly at noon one day. How slow will the clock be, rounded to the nearest second, after(24.00) hours have passed, assuming the pendulum has kept perfect time before the change? 
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 


A1 = 3600*24*(1-(1/sqrt(1.01)))
