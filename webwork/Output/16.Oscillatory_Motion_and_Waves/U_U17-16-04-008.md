## Question Section 

<b>
A pendulum with a period of(2.000)(s) in one location where the acceleration due to gravity is(9.80)(ms^2) is moved to a new location where the period is now(period)(s). What is the acceleration due to gravity at its new location?
ans_rule(40) (ms^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
period = randrange(1.99500,1.99999,1.00001) 

A1 =((9.8)*((2/(period))**(2)))
