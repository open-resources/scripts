## Question Section 

<b>
How much energy must the shock absorbers of a(mass)-(kg) car dissipate in order to damp a bounce that initially has a velocity of(speed)(ms) at the equilibrium position? Assume the car returns to its original vertical position.
ans_rule(40)(J)

## G
car dissipate in order to damp a bounce that initially has a velocity of(speed)(ms) at the equilibrium position? Assume the car returns to its original vertical position.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(900,1500,10)
speed = randrange(0.2,1.2,0.05)

A1 = (0.5)*(mass)*(speed)**(2)
