## Question Section 

<b>
A ladybug sits(distance)(cm) from the center of a Beatles music album spinning at(rpm)(rpm). What is the maximum velocity of its shadow on the wall behind the turntable, if illuminated parallel to the record by the parallel rays of the setting Sun?
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(8,20,1)
rpm = randrange(20.00,50.00,0.01)

A1 = (rpm)*(1/60)*(2)*(pi)*(distance)/(100)
