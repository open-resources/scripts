## Question Section 

<b>
A diver on a diving board is undergoing simple harmonic motion. Her mass is(mass)(kg) and the period of her motion is(T)(s). The next diver is a male whose period of simple harmonic oscillation is(T2)(s). What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?
ans_rule(40)(kg)

## G
and the period of her motion is(T)(s). The next diver is a male whose period of simple harmonic oscillation is(T2)(s). What is his mass if the mass of the board is negligible?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(50,60,0.1)
T = randrange(0.6,1,0.05)
T2 = randrange(1,1.4,0.05)

A1 = ((mass)*(T2/T)**2)
