## Question Section 

<b>
Twin jet engines on an airplane are producing an average sound frequency of(favg)(Hz) with a beat frequency of(fbeat)(Hz). What are their individual frequencies?
Assuming(f_1) >(f_2):
(f_1) =ans_rule(20)(Hz) ,(f_2) =ans_rule(20)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
favg = randrange(4000,4200,1)
fbeat = randrange(0.2,1,0.01)

A1 = favg+fbeat
A2 = favg-fbeat
