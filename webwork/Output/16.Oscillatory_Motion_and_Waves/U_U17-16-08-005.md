## Question Section 

<b>
Engineering Application: A suspension bridge oscillates with an effective force constant of(forcetimes 10^8)(Nm). 
a) How much energy is needed to make it oscillate with an amplitude of(distance)(m)?
ans_rule(40)(J)

## A
How much energy is needed to make it oscillate with an amplitude of(distance)(m)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(0.5,1.5,0.01)
distance = randrange(0.05,0.2,0.001)
distance2 = randrange(0.4,0.6,0.001)
energy = randrange(0.5,2,0.01)


A1 = (0.5)*((force)*(10)**(8))*(distance)**(2) 
A2 = (((force)*(10)**(8))*((distance2)**(2)-(distance)**(2)))/((2)*((energy)*(10)**(4)))
