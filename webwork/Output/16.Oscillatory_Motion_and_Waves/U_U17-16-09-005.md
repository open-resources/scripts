## Question Section 

<b>
Scouts at a camp shake the rope bridge they have just crossed and observe the wave crests to be(length)(m) apart. If they shake it the bridge twice per second, what is the propagation speed of the waves?
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(5,15,0.1)

A1 = (2)*(length)
