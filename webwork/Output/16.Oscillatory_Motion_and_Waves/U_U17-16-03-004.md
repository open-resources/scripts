## Question Section 

<b>
A(mass)(kg) object attached to a spring initially oscillates with a period of(T1)(s).
(a) What increase in mass is required such that the new period is no greater than(T2)(s)?
ans_rule(40)(kg)

## A
What increase in mass is required such that the new period is no greater than(T2)(s)?
### Answer Section
## G
object attached to a spring initially oscillates with a period of(T1)(s).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

pi = Real("pi")
mass = sprintf("%0.3f",0.5)
T1 = sprintf("%0.2f",2.00)
T2 = 2.01
A1 = 0.5*(2.01/2)**2-0.5
A2 = A1/0.5*100
