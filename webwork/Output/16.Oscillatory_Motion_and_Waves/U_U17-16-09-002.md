## Question Section 

Waves on a swimming pool propagate at(speed)(ms). You splash the water at one end of the pool and observe the wave go to the opposite end, reflect, and return in(time)(s). How far away is the other end of the pool?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(20,40,0.1)
speed = randrange(0.5,1,0.01)

A1 = ((speed)*(time))/2
