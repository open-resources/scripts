## Question Section 

A spring rests at its equilibrium length of(a) cm. You compress the spring to a new length of(b) cm, holding the spring at rest at its new length. You do(W) J of work on the spring during the compression process. Friction, air resistance, and other dissipative forces can be neglected, and the motion takes place in a horizontal plane.
a) Determine the elastic potential energy stored in the spring.
ans_rule(40) J

## A
cm. You compress the spring to a new length of(b) cm, holding the spring at rest at its new length. You do(W) J of work on the spring during the compression process. Friction, air resistance, and other dissipative forces can be neglected, and the motion takes place in a horizontal plane.
### Answer Section
## B
cm, holding the spring at rest at its new length. You do(W) J of work on the spring during the compression process. Friction, air resistance, and other dissipative forces can be neglected, and the motion takes place in a horizontal plane.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

W = randrange(400,700,10)
a = randrange(26,30,0.2)
b = randrange(22,24,0.1)
x = (a-b)/100
k = 2*W/(x**2)
F = k*x
