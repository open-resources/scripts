## Question Section 

<b>
What is the intensity of a laser beam used to burn away cancerous tissue that, when(percent)(%) absorbed, puts(power)(J) of energy into a circular spot(diameter)(mm) in diameter in(time)(s)?
ans_rule(40)(Wm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(3,5,0.01)
percent = randrange(80,95,0.1)
power = randrange(400,600,1)
diameter = randrange(1.5,3,0.01)
r2 = (diameter/2000)**(2)

A1 = (power)/(((percent)/(100))*(pi)*(r2)*(time))
