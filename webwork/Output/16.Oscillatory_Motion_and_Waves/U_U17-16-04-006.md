## Question Section 

<b>
Two parakeets sit on a swing with their combined center of mass(length)(m) below the pivot. At what frequency do they swing?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 
length = randrange(0.02,0.20,0.001)

A1 = (2*pi*(((length)/(9.8))**(1/2)))**(-1)
