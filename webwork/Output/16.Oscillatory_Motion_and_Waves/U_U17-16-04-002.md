## Question Section 

<b>
Some people think a pendulum with a period of(1.00)(s) can be driven with “mental energy” or psycho kinetically, because its period is the same as an average heartbeat. True or not, what is the length of such a pendulum?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 

A1 = ((1)**(2))*(9.8)/(4*(pi**(2)))
