## Question Section 

<b>
The amplitude of a lightly damped oscillator decreases by(percent)(%) during each cycle. What is the percent decrease in mechanical energy per cycle?
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(1,10,0.1)

A1 = 100*(1-(1-percent/100)**2)
