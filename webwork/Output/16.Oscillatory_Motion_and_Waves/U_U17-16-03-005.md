## Question Section 

<b>
An object is attached to a spring at its unloaded rest position and allowed to bounce up and down.
a)  If the spring has a force constant of(force)(Nm) and a(mass)(kg) mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations.
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
 If the spring has a force constant of(force)(Nm) and a(mass)(kg) mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations.
### Answer Section
## G
mass object is set in motion as described, find the amplitude of the oscillations.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.1,0.3,0.01)
force = randrange(8,12,0.1)


A2 = (mass)*(9.80)/(force)
A3 = ((force)/(mass))**(1/2)*(A2)
