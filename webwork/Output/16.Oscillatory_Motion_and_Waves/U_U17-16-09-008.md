## Question Section 

<b>
Radio waves transmitted through space at(3.00times 10^8)(ms) by the Voyager spacecraft have a wavelength of(distance)(m). What is their frequency?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(0.1,0.2,0.001)

A1 = (300000000)/(distance)
