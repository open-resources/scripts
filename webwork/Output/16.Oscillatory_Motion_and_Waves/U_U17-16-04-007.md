## Question Section 

<b>
A pendulum that has a period of(T)(m) and that is located where the acceleration due to gravity is(9.79)(ms^2) is moved to a location where the acceleration due to gravity is (9.82)(ms^2). What is its new period?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(5.00,10.00,1.03) 
T = randrange(2,4,0.1)


A1 = (T)*((9.79)/(9.82))**(1/2)
