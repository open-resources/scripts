## Question Section 

<b>
Wind gusts create ripples on the ocean that have a wavelength of(length)(m) and propagate at(speed)(ms). What is their frequency?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(0.01,0.10,0.001)
speed = randrange(1,9,0.01)

A1 = (speed)/(length)
