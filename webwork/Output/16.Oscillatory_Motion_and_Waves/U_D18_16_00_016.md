## Question Section 

A block attached to a spring undergoes simple harmonic motion, sliding back and forth along a straight line on a horizontal, frictionless surface. The amplitude of the block's motion is(X) cm, the spring's stiffness constant is(k) Nm, and the mass of the block is(m) kg. Determine the maximum speed of the block.
ans_rule(40) ms

## K
Nm, and the mass of the block is(m) kg. Determine the maximum speed of the block.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

X = randrange (35,55,1)
k = randrange (20,40,1)
m = randrange (0.5,1.5,0.1)
v = (X/100)*(k/m)**(0.5)
