## Question Section 

<b>
A tire has a tread pattern with a crevice every(x)(cm). Each crevice makes a single vibration as the tire moves. What is the frequency of these vibrations if the car moves at(speed)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
x = randrange(1,5,0.1)
speed = randrange(25,35,0.1)
A1 = speed/(x/100)
