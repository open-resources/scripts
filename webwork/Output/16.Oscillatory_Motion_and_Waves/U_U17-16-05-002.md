## Question Section 

<b>
Engineering Application: Near the top of the Citigroup Center building in New York City, there is an object with mass of(4.00times 10^5)(kg) on springs that have adjustable force constants. Its function is to dampen wind-driven oscillations of the building by oscillating at the same frequency as the building is being driven—the driving force is transferred to the object, which oscillates instead of the entire building.
a)  Which effective stiffness constant should the springs have to make the object oscillate with a period of(period)(s)?
ans_rule(40)(Nm)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
period = randrange(1.00,10.00,1) 
length = randrange(1.00,10.00,1) 

A1 = (4*(((2143/22)**(1/4))**(2))*(400000))/((period)**(2)) 
A2 = (0.5)*(A1)*((length)**(2))
