## Question Section 

<b>
How many times a minute does a boat bob up and down on ocean waves that have a wavelength of(length)(m) and a propagation speed of(speed)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(times)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(30,50,0.1)
speed = randrange(2,9,0.01)

A1 = ((speed)/(length))*(60)
