## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a diving board with no one on it bounces up and down in a simple harmonic motion with a frequency of(freq)(Hz). The board has an effective mass of(mass)(kg). What is the frequency of the simple harmonic motion of a(mass2)-(kg) diver on the board? 
ans_rule(40)(Hz)

## G
diver on the board? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
freq = randrange(2,4,0.1)
mass = randrange(8.00,12.00,0.1) 
mass2 = randrange(60,80,0.5)

A1 = (freq)*((mass)/(mass2+mass))**(1/2)
