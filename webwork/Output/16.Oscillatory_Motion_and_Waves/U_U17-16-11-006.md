## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have a device that extracts energy from ocean breakers in direct proportion to their intensity. If the device produces(power)(kW) of power on a day when the breakers are(height)(m) high, how much will it produce when they are(height2)(m) high?
ans_rule(40)(kW)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
power = randrange(5,20,0.1)
height = randrange(1,1.5,0.01)
height2 = randrange(0.5,0.99,0.01)

A1 = (power)*(((height2)/(height))**(2))
