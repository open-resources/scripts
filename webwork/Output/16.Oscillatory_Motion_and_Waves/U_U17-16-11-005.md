## Question Section 

<b>
Astronomy Application: Energy from the Sun arrives at the top of the Earth's atmosphere with an intensity of(intensity)(kWm^2) . How long does it take for(powertimes 10^9)(J)  to arrive on an area of(1)(m^2) ?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
intensity = randrange(1,2,0.01)
power = randrange(1,2,0.01)

A1 = (power/intensity)*(10)**(6)
