## Question Section 

<b>
The length of nylon rope from which a mountain climber is suspended has a force constant of(force)(Nm).
a) What is the frequency at which he bounces, given his mass plus and the mass of his equipment are(mass)(kg)?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)

## A
What is the frequency at which he bounces, given his mass plus and the mass of his equipment are(mass)(kg)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(80,100,1)
force = randrange(13000, 15000, 100) 
fall = randrange(1.50,2.50,0.01)

A1 = (1/(2*(pi)))*sqrt((force)/(mass))
A2 = ((mass)*9.80+sqrt(((mass*9.8)**2)+(mass)*2*(9.8)*(force)*(fall)))/(force)
