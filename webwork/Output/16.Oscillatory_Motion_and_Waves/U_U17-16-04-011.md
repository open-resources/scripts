## Question Section 

<b>
At what rate will a pendulum clock run on the Moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is(moongravity)(ms^2) if it keeps time accurately on Earth? That is, find the time (in hours) it takes the clock's hour hand to make one revolution on the Moon.
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

moongravity = 1.622 

A1 = sqrt((9.8)/(1.622))
