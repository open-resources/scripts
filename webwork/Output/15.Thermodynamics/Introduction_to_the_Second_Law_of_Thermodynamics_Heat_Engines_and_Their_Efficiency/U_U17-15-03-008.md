## Question Section 

<b>
This problem compares the energy output and heat transfer to the environment by two different types of nuclear power stationsâ€”one with the normal efficiency of(eff)(%), and another with an improved efficiency of(eff2)(%). Suppose both have the same heat transfer into the engine in one day,(heattimes 10^14)(J).
a) How much more electrical energy is produced by the more efficient power station?
ans_rule(40)(J)

## A
How much more electrical energy is produced by the more efficient power station?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(20,35,0.01)
eff2 = randrange(36,50,0.01)
heat = randrange(1,6,0.01)

A1 =(heat*(10**(14)))*((eff2/100)-(eff/100)) 
A2 = -A1
