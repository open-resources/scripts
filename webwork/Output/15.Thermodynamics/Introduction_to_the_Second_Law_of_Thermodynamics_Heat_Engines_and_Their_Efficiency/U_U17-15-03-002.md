## Question Section 

<b>
With(heattimes 10^6)(J) of heat transfer into this engine, a given cyclical heat engine can do only (worktimes 10^5)(J) of work. 
a) What is the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage?
ans_rule(40)(%)

What is the engine's efficiency, expressed as a percentage?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heat = randrange(2,4,0.01)
work = randrange(1,2,0.01)
A1 = ((work)/(heat*10))*100
A2 = ((heat*10)-(work))*(10**(5))
