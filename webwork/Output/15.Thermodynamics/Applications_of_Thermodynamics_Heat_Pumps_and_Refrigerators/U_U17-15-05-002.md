## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have an ideal refrigerator that cools an environment at (temp^circC) and has heat transfer to another environment at(temp2^circC). What is its coefficient of performance?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(-30,-10,0.1))
temp2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(40,70,0.1))

A1 = (temp+273.15)/((temp2+273.15)-(temp+273.15))
