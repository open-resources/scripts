What is the best coefficient of performance for a heat pump that has a hot reservoir temperature of(temp^circC) and a cold reservoir temperature of(temp2^circC)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(40,60,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(-30,-10,0.1)
cents = randrange(60,90,0.1)
work = randrange(2,6,0.01)
A1 = (temp+273.15)/((temp+273.15)-(temp2+273.15))
A2 = (A1)*(work*(10**(7)))/(4186)
