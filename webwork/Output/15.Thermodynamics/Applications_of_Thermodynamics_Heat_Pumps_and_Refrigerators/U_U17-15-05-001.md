## Question Section 

<b>
What is the coefficient of performance of an ideal heat pump that has heat transfer from a cold temperature of(-temp^circC) to a hot temperature of(temp2^circC) ?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,30,0.1))
temp2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,50,0.1))

A1 = (temp2+273.15)/(temp2+273.15-(-temp+273.15))
