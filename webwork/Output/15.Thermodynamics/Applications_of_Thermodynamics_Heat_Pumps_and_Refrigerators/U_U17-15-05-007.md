## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you want to operate an ideal refrigerator with a cold temperature of(temp^circC), and you would like it to have a coefficient of performance of(performance). What is the hot reservoir temperature for such a refrigerator? 
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(-20,0,0.1)
performance = randrange(5,10,0.01)

A1 = (((temp+273.15)/(performance))+(temp+273.15))-273.15
