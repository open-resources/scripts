## Question Section 

<b>
In a very mild winter climate, a heat pump has heat transfer from an environment at(temp^circC) to one at(temp2^circC). What is the best possible coefficient of performance for these temperatures?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(0,15,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(20,50,0.1)
A1 = (temp2+273.15)/((temp2+273.15)-(temp+273.15))
