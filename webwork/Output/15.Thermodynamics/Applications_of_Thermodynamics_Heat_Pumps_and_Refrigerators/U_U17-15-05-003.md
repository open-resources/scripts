## Question Section 

<b>
What is the best coefficient of performance possible for a hypothetical refrigerator that could make liquid nitrogen at(temp^circC) and has heat transfer to the environment at(temp2^circC)  ?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(-150,-300,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(10,50,0.1)
A1 = (temp+273.15)/((temp2+273.15)-(temp+273.15))
