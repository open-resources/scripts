## Question Section 

<b>
In an air conditioner,(heat)(MJ) of heat transfer occurs from a cold environment in(1.00)(h). The latent heat is equal to(3.34times 10^5)(Jkg).
a) What mass of ice melting would involve the same heat transfer?
ans_rule(40)(kg)

## A
What mass of ice melting would involve the same heat transfer?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
massSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(700,1000,0.1))
heat = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(10,15,0.01))
heatSI = heat*10**6
Lf = 334000

A1 = (heatSI)/(Lf)
A2 = (massSI*Lf)/(heatSI)
