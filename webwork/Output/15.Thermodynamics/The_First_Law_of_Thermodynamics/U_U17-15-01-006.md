## A
How much food energy will a man metabolize in the process of doing(work)(kJ) of work with an efficiency of(eff)(%)?(1)(kcal) contains(4.186)(kJ).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(3,10,0.01)
work = randrange(20,80,0.1)
A1 = (work)*(1/4.186)/(eff/100)
A2 = (A1)*(-(eff/100)+1)
