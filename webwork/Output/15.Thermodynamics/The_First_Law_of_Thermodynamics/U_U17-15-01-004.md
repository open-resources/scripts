## Question Section 

<b>
What is the change in internal energy of a system which does(workdonetimes 10^5)(J)  of work while(heatintimes 10^6)(J) of heat transfer occurs into the system, and(heatouttimes 10^6)(J) of heat transfer occurs to the environment?
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heatin = randrange(1,5.99,0.01)
heatout = randrange(6,9.99,0.01)
workdone = randrange(2,8,0.01)
A1 = ((heatin)-(heatout))-workdone
