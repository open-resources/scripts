## Question Section 

<b>
How long will the energy in a(energy)-(kcal) cup of yogurt last in a woman doing work at the rate of(rate)(W) with an efficiency of(eff)(%) ? There are(4186)(Jkcal).
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(200,500,0.1)
rate = randrange(100,300,0.1)
eff = randrange(15,30,0.1)

A1 = (eff/100)*(energy)*(4186)/(rate)
