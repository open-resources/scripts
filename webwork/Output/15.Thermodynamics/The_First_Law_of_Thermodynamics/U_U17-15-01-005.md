## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a woman does(work)(J) of work and(heat)(J) of heat transfer occurs into the environment in the process.
a) What is the decrease in her internal energy, assuming no change in temperature or consumption of food? (That is, there is no other energy transfer.)

## A
What is the decrease in her internal energy, assuming no change in temperature or consumption of food? (That is, there is no other energy transfer.) 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
work = randrange(50,200,0.1)
heat = randrange(5000,10000,1)

A1 = (work)+(heat)
A2 = (work)/(A1)
