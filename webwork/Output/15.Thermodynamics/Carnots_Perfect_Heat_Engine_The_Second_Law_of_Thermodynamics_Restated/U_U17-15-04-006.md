## Question Section 

<b>
A coal-fired electrical power station has an efficiency of(eff)(%). The temperature of the steam leaving the boiler is (temp^circC) . What percentage of the maximum efficiency does this station obtain? (Assume the temperature of the environment is (temp2^circC).)
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(500,600,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(10,30,0.1)
eff = randrange(30,50,0.1)
A1 = ((eff/100)/((1)-((temp2+273.15)/(temp+273.15))))*(100)
