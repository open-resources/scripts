## Question Section 

<b>
A certain gasoline engine has an efficiency of(eff)(%). What would the hot reservoir temperature be for a Carnot engine having that efficiency, if it operates with a cold reservoir temperature of(temp^circC)?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(150,250,0.1)
eff = randrange(20,40,0.01)

A1 = (temp+273.15)/((1)-(eff/100))-273.15
