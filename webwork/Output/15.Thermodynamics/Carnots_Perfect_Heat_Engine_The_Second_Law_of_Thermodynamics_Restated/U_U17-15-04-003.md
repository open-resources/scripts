What is the hot reservoir temperature of a Carnot engine that has an efficiency of(eff)(%) and a cold reservoir temperature of(temp^circC)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(30,60,0.1)
temp = randrange(20,30,0.1)
eff2 = randrange(50,80,0.1)
A1 = (((temp+273.15)/((1)-(eff/100))))-273.15
A2 = (temp+273.15)/((1)-((eff)/(eff2)))-273.15
