## A
What maximum efficiency can be obtained from an engine operating between(templow)(K) and(temphigh)(K)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temphigh = randrange(550,600,1)
templow = randrange(250,300,1)
heatinput = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(25,30,0.1))
workdone = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(10,15,0.1))

effCarnot = ((temphigh)-(templow))/(temphigh)*100
effReal = (workdone)/(heatinput)*100
