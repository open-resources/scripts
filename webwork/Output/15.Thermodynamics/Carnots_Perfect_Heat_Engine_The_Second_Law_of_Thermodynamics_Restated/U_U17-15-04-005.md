## Question Section 

<b>
Practical steam engines utilize(temp^circC) steam, which is later exhausted at(temp2^circC) .
a) What is the maximum efficiency that such a heat engine can have?
b) Since(temp2^circC) steam is still quite hot, a second steam engine is sometimes operated using the exhaust of the first. What is the maximum efficiency of the second engine if its exhaust has a temperature of(temp3^circC)?
c) What is the overall efficiency of the two engines?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(400,500,0.1))
temp2 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(200,300,0.1))
temp3 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(100,199,0.1))

A1 = (1-((temp2+273.15)/(temp+273.15)))*100
A2 = (1-((temp3+273.15)/(temp2+273.15)))*100
A3 = ((1)-((1)-(A1/100))*((1)-(A2/100)))*100
