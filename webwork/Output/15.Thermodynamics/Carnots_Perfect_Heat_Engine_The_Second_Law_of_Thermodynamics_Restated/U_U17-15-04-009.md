## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Calculate the cold reservoir temperature of a steam engine that uses hot steam at(temp^circC) and has a Carnot efficiency of(eff)(%).
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(50,90,0.1)
temp = randrange(400,600,0.1)
A1 = ((temp+273.15)*((1)-(eff/100)))-273.15
