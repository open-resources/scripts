## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Suppose you want to design a steam engine that has heat transfer to the environment at(temp^circC) and has a Carnot efficiency of(eff)(%). 
a) What temperature of hot steam must you use?
ans_rule(40)(K)

## A
What temperature of hot steam must you use?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(72,90,0.1))
temp = randrange(250,350,0.1)

A1 = ((temp+273.15)/((1)-(eff/100)))
