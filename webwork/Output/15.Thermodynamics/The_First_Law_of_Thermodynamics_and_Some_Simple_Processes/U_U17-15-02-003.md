## Question Section 

<b>
Steam to drive an old-fashioned steam locomotive is supplied at a constant gauge pressure of(pressuretimes 10^6)(Nm^2) to a piston with a(radius)(m) radius.
a) Find the work done by the steam when the piston moves(distance)(m). Note that this is the net work output, since gauge pressure is used.
ans_rule(40)(J)

## A
Find the work done by the steam when the piston moves(distance)(m). Note that this is the net work output, since gauge pressure is used.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
radius = randrange(0.1,0.5,0.001)
pressure = randrange(1,4,0.01)
distance = randrange(0.6,1,0.001)
A1 = (pressure*(10**(6)))*(pi)*(distance)*((radius)**(2))
A2 = A1
