## Question Section 

<b>
A car tire contains(volume)(m^2) of a monatomic gas at a pressure of(pressuretimes 10^5)(Nm^2). How much more internal energy does this gas have than the same volume has at zero gauge pressure (which is equivalent to normal atmospheric pressure)?
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
volume = randrange(0.02,0.05,0.0001)
pressure = randrange(1,4,0.01)
A1 = (((pressure)/(1.013))*((1.5)*(1.013*(10**(5)))*(volume)))-((1.5)*(1.013*(10**(5)))*(volume))
