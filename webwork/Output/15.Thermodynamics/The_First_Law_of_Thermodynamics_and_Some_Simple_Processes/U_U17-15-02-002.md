## Question Section 

<b>
A helium-filled toy balloon has a gauge pressure of(pressure)(atm) and a volume of(volume)(L). How much greater is the internal energy of the helium in the balloon than it would be at zero gauge pressure?
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
volume = randrange(5,20,0.1)

pressure = randrange(0.1,0.4,0.001)
A1 = (((1+pressure)/(1))*((1.5)*(101300)*(volume*(0.001))))-((1.5)*(101300)*(volume*0.001))
