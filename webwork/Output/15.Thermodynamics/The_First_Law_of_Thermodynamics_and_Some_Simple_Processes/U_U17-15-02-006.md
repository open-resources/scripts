## Question Section 

![PV Diagram]("NU_U17-15-02-006.png")

<b>
What is the net work output of a heat engine that follows path(ABDA) in the figure above, with a straight line from(B) to(D)?
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

#AB = -(3/15)V+(42/15)
#BD = (5/15)V+(10/15)

#Integrate from V=1 to V=4 to solve for area

work = (36/15)*1000
