## Question Section 

<b>
On a hot summer day,(heattimes 10^6)(J) of heat transfer into a parked car takes place, increasing its temperature from(temp^circC) to(temp2^circC). What is the increase in entropy of the car due to this heat transfer alone?
ans_rule(40)(JK)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(20,39,0.01)
temp2 = randrange(40,60,0.1)
heat = randrange(2,7,0.01)
A1 = (heat*(10**(6)))/((temp+temp2+2*273.15)/(2))
