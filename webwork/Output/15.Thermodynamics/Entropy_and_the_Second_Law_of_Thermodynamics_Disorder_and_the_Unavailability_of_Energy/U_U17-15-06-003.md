## Question Section 

<b>
A hot rock ejected from a volcano's lava fountain cools quickly from(temp^circC) to(temp2^circC), and its entropy decreases by(entropy)(JK). How much heat transfer occurs from the rock?
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(1240,1250,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(1230,1239,0.1)
entropy = randrange(160,180,10)
A1 = ((temp+temp2+2*273.15)/(2))*(entropy)
