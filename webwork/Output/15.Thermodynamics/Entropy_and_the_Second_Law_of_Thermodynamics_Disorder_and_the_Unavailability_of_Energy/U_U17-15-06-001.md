## Question Section 

<b>
On a winter day, a certain house loses(heattimes 10^8)(J) of heat to the outside. What is the total change in entropy due to this heat transfer alone, assuming an average indoor temperature of(temp^circC) and an average outdoor temperature of (temp2^circC)?
ans_rule(40)(JK)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heat = randrange(3,8,0.01)
temp = randrange(15,30,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(2,9,0.1)

A1 = (heat*(10**(8)))*((1/(temp2+273.15))-(1/(temp+273.15)))
