### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
eff = randrange(20,25,0.1)
percent = eff/100
tempwater = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,40,0.1))
tempwaterK = tempwater+273.15
templow = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,19.9,0.1))
templowK = templow+273.15
temphigh = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20.1,25,0.1))
temphighK = temphigh+273.15
tempaverageK = 0.5*(temphighK+templowK)
power = randrange(980,1000,10)
powerSI = power*10**6
energySI = powerSI*86400

heatinput = (energySI)/(percent)
heatenviro = heatinput*(1-percent)
deltaS = heatenviro*(tempaverageK**-1-tempwaterK**-1)
lostwork = deltaS*templowK
