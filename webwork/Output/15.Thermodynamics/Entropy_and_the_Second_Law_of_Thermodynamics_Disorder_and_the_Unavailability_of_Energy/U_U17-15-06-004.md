## Question Section 

<b>
When(heattimes 10^3)(J)  of heat transfer occurs into a meat pie initially at(temp^circC), its entropy increases by(entropy)(JK). What is its final temperature?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
heat = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,9,0.01))
temp = randrange(10,30,0.1)
entropy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(27.5,27.9,0.01))
A1 = ((2)*(heat*(10**(3)))/(entropy)-(temp+273.15))-273.15
