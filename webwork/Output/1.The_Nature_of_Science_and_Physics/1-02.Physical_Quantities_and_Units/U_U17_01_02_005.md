## Question Section 

 
Soccer fields vary in size. A large soccer field is(length,m) long and(width,m) wide. What are its dimensions in(feet)? (Assume that(1,meter) equals(3.281,feet).)
Length =ans_rule(15)(feet)
Width =ans_rule(15)(feet)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(110,120,1)
width = randrange(80,90,1)

E = length*3.281
F = width*3.281
