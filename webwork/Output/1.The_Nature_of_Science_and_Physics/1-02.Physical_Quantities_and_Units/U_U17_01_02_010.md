## Question Section 

 
a) The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about(1.5times 10^8,km). Calculate the average speed of the Earth in its orbit in kilometers per second. Assume that one year is equal to(365.25,days).
ans_rule(40) (kms)
b) What is this in meters per second?
ans_rule(40) (ms)

## A
The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about(1.5times 10^8,km). Calculate the average speed of the Earth in its orbit in kilometers per second. Assume that one year is equal to(365.25,days).
### Answer Section
## B
What is this in meters per second?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

E = (2*pi*1.5*10**(8))/(365.25*24*3600)
F = E*10**3
