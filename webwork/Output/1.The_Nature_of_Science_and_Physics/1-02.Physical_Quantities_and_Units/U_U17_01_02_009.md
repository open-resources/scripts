## Question Section 

 
Tectonic plates are large segments of the Earth's crust that move slowly. Suppose that one such plate has an average speed of(speed,cmyear).
a) What distance does it move in(1,s) at this speed?
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-9,m)
b) What is its speed in kilometers per million years?
ans_rule(40) (kmMy)

## A
What distance does it move in(1,s) at this speed?
### Answer Section
## B
What is its speed in kilometers per million years?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(3.5,4.5,0.5)

E = (speed/100/365/24/3600)*10**9
F = speed/100/1000*10**6
