## Question Section 

A car engine moves a piston with a circular cross section of(diameterpm uncertainty_diameter,cm) diameter a distance of(distancepm uncertainty_distance,cm) to compress the gas in the cylinder.
a) By what amount is the gas decreased in volume in cubic centimeters?
ans_rule(40)(cm^3)
b) Find the uncertainty in this volume.
ans_rule(40)(cm^3)

## A
By what amount is the gas decreased in volume in cubic centimeters?
### Answer Section
## B
Find the uncertainty in this volume.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(7.25,7.75,0.25)
distance = randrange(3,3.5,0.25)
uncertainty_diameter = randrange(0.001,0.003,0.001)
uncertainty_distance = randrange(0.001,0.003,0.001)

E = pi*((0.5*diameter)**2)*distance
F = ((uncertainty_diameter/diameter)+(uncertainty_distance/distance))*E
