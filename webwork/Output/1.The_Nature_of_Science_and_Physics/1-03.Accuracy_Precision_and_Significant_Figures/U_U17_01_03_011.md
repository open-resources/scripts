## Question Section 

 
A person measures his or her heart rate by counting the number of beats in(30,s). If(beatspm uncertainty,beats) are counted in(30pm 0.5,s), what is the heart rate and its uncertainty in beats per minute?
Rate =ans_rule(10) (beatsmin)
Uncertainty =(pm)ans_rule(10) (beatsmin)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
beats = randrange(35,45,1)
uncertainty = randrange(1,2,1)

margin = (uncertainty/beats)*100+(0.5/30)*100

E = beats*2
F = (margin/100)*E
