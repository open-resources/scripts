## Question Section 

The length and width of a rectangular room are measured to be(3.955pm 0.005,m) and(3.050pm 0.005,m) . Calculate the area of the room and its uncertainty in square meters.
Area =ans_rule(40)(m^2)
Uncertainty =(pm)ans_rule(40)(m^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length_1 = randrange(3.9,4,0.01)
length_2 = randrange(3,3.1,0.01)
uncertainty_1 = randrange(0.004,0.006,0.001)
uncertainty_2 = randrange(0.004,0.006,0.001)

E = length_1*length_2
F = ((uncertainty_1/length_1)+(uncertainty_2/length_2))*E
