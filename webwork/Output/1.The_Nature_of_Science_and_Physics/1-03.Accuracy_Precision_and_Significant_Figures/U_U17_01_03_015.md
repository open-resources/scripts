## Question Section 

The side lengths of a small rectangular box are measured to be(length_1pm uncertainty_1,cm),(length_2pm uncertainty_2,cm), and(length_3pm uncertainty_3,cm). Calculate the volume of the box and the uncertainty in the volume in(cubic centimeters).
Volume =ans_rule(40)(cm^3)
Uncertainty =(pm)ans_rule(40)(cm^3)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length_1 = randrange(1.6,1.8,0.05)
length_2 = randrange(1.95,2.15,0.05)
length_3 = randrange(3,3.2,0.05)
uncertainty_1 = randrange(0.01,0.03,0.01)
uncertainty_2 = randrange(0.01,0.03,0.01)
uncertainty_3 = randrange(0.01,0.03,0.01)

E = length_1*length_2*length_3
F = ((uncertainty_1/length_1)+(uncertainty_2/length_2)+(uncertainty_3/length_3))*E
