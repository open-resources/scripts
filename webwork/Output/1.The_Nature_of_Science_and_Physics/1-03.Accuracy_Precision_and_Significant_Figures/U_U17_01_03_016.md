## Question Section 

When non-metric units were used in the United Kingdom, a unit of mass called the pound-mass (lbm) was employed, where(1,lbm = 0.4539,kg).
a) If there is an uncertainty of(uncertainty,kg) in the pound-mass unit, what is its percent uncertainty?
ans_rule(40)(%)
b) Based on that percent uncertainty, what mass in pound-mass has an uncertainty of(1,kg) when converted to kilograms?
ans_rule(40)(lbm)

## A
If there is an uncertainty of(uncertainty,kg) in the pound-mass unit, what is its percent uncertainty?
### Answer Section
## B
Based on that percent uncertainty, what mass in pound-mass has an uncertainty of(1,kg) when converted to kilograms?
### Answer Section
## G
in the pound-mass unit, what is its percent uncertainty?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
uncertainty = randrange(0.0001,0.0003,0.0001)

E = (uncertainty/0.4539)*100
F = (1/(E/100))*(1/0.4539)
