## Question Section 

A marathon runner completes a(distance-km) course in(hours,h),(mins,min), and(secs,s). There is an uncertainty of(uncertainty_d,m) in the distance traveled and an uncertainty of(1,s) in the elapsed time.
a) Calculate the percent uncertainty in the distance.
ans_rule(40)(%)
b) Calculate the uncertainty in the elapsed time.
ans_rule(40)(%)
c) What is the average speed in(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(ms)
d) What is the uncertainty in the average speed in(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(41.5,42.5,0.1)
hours = 2
mins = randrange(15,45,1)
secs = randrange(1,59,1)
uncertainty_d = randrange(20,25,1)
uncertainty_t = 1

time = hours*3600+mins*60+secs

E = (uncertainty_d/(distance*1000))*100
F = (uncertainty_t/time)*100
G = (distance*1000/time)
H = ((E/100)+(F/100))*G
