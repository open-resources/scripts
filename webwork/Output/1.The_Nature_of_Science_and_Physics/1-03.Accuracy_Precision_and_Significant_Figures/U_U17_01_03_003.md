## Question Section 

 
a) A car speedometer has a(percent,%) uncertainty. What is the range of possible speeds when it reads(speed,kmh)?
Fromans_rule(15) (kmh) toans_rule(15) (kmh)
b) Convert this range to miles per hour. ((1,km = 0.6214,mi))
Fromans_rule(15) (mih) toans_rule(15) (mih)

## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(2,6,1)
speed = randrange(85,95,1)

margin = (percent/100)*speed

E = speed-margin
F = speed+margin
G = E*0.6214
H = F*0.6214
