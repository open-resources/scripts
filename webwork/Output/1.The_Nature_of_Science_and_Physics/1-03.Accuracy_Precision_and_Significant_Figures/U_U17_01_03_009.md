## Question Section 

 
a) If your speedometer has an uncertainty of(uncertainty,kmh) at a speed of(speed,kmh), what is the percent uncertainty?
ans_rule(40) (%)
b) If it has the same percent uncertainty when it reads(speed_2,kmh), what is the range of speeds you could be going?
Fromans_rule(10) (kmh) toans_rule(10) (kmh)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
uncertainty = randrange(1.5,2.5,0.5)
speed = randrange(85,95,1)
speed_2 = randrange(55,65,1)

E = (uncertainty/speed)*100
margin = (E/100)*speed_2
F = speed_2-margin
G = speed_2+margin
