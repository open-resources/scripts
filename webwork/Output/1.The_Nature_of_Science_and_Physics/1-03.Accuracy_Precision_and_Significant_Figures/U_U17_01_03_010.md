## Question Section 

 
a) A person's blood pressure is measured to be(measurement_1pm uncertainty,mm Hg). What is its percent uncertainty?
ans_rule(40) (%)
b) Assuming the same percent uncertainty, what is the uncertainty in a blood pressure measurement of(measurement_2,mm Hg)?
ans_rule(40) (mm Hg)

## A
A person's blood pressure is measured to be(measurement_1pm uncertainty,mm Hg). What is its percent uncertainty?
### Answer Section
## B
Assuming the same percent uncertainty, what is the uncertainty in a blood pressure measurement of(measurement_2,mm Hg)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
uncertainty = randrange(2,3,1)
measurement_1 = randrange(110,125,1)
measurement_2 = randrange(75,85,1)

E = (uncertainty/measurement_1)*100
F = (E/100)*measurement_2
