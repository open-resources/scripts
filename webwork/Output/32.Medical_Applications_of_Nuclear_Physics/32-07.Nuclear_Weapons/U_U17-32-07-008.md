## Question Section 

This problem gives some idea of the magnitude of the energy yield of a small tactical
bomb. Assume that half the energy of a(kT)-kT nuclear depth charge set off under an
aircraft carrier goes into lifting it out of the waterâ€”that is, into gravitational
potential energy. How high is the carrier lifted if its mass is(mass) tons?
ans_rule(40) km
