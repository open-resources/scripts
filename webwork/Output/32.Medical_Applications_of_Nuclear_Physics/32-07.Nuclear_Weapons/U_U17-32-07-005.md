## Question Section 

A radiation-enhanced nuclear weapon (or neutron bomb) can have a smaller total
yield and still produce more prompt radiation than a conventional nuclear bomb. This
allows the use of neutron bombs to kill nearby advancing enemy forces with radiation
without blowing up your own forces with the blast. For a(massradiation)-kT radiation enhanced
weapon and a(massconventional)-kT conventional nuclear bomb: 
a) What is the blast yield for the radiation enhanced weapon?
