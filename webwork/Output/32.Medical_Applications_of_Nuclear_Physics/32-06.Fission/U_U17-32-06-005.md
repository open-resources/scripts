## Question Section 

Breeding plutonium produces energy even before any plutonium is fissioned. (The
primary purpose of the four nuclear reactors at Chernobyl was breeding plutonium for
weapons. Electrical power was a by-product used by the civilian population.) Calculate
the energy produced in each of the reactions listed for plutonium breeding just
following Example 32.4. The pertinent masses are(m)(^239)U =(massU)u,
(m)(^239)Np =(massNp)u, and(m)(^239)Pu =(massPu)u.
i)(^238)U+(n) ->(^239)U+(gamma)
ans_rule(40) MeV
