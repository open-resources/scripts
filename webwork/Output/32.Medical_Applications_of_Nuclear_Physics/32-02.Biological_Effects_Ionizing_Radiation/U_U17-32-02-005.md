## Question Section 

One half the(gamma) rays from(^99mTc) are absorbed by a(thick)-mm-thick lead shielding. Half of the(gamma) rays that pass through the first layer of lead are absorbed in a second layer of equal thickness. What thickness of lead will absorb all but one in(1000) of these(gamma) rays? 
ans_rule(40) mm
