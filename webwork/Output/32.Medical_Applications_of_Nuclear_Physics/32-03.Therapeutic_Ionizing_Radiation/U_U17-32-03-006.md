## Question Section 

Large amounts of(^65Zn) are produced in copper exposed to accelerator beams. While machining contaminated copper, a physicist ingests(uCi) μCi of(^65Zn). Each(^65Zn) decay emits an average(gamma) -ray energy of(MeV) MeV,(percent)% of which is absorbed in the scientist's(mass)-kg body. What dose in mSv is caused by this in one day? 
ans_rule(40) mSvd
