## Question Section 

a) A cancer patient is exposed to(gamma) rays from a(5000)-Ci(^60Co) transillumination unit for(time) s. The(gamma) rays are collimated in such a manner that only(1.00)% of them strike the patient. Of those,(20.0)% are absorbed in a tumor having a mass of(mass) kg. What is the dose in rem to the tumor, if the average(gamma) energy per decay is(1.25) MeV? 
None  of the(beta) s from the decay reach the patient.  
ans_rule(40)

## A
A cancer patient is exposed to(gammrays from a(5000)-Ci(^60Co) transillumination unit for(time) s. The(gammrays are collimated in such a manner that only(1.00)% of them strike the patient. Of those,(20.0)% are absorbed in a tumor having a mass of(mass) kg. What is the dose in rem to the tumor, if the average(gammenergy per decay is(1.25) MeV?
