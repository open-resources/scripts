## Question Section 

The activities of(^131I) and(^123I) used in thyroid scans are given to be(uCi131) and(uCi123)μCi , respectively. Find the masses of(^131I) and(^123I) in such scans, given their respective half-lives are(time131) d and(time123) h. The masses are so small that the radio iodine is usually mixed with stable iodine as a carrier to ensure normal chemistry and distribution in the body.
ans_rule(40) g of(^131I)
ans_rule(40) g of(^123I)
