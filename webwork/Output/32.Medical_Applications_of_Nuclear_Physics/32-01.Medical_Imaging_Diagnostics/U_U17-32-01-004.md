## Question Section 

a)Two annihilation(gamma) rays in a PET scan originate at the same point and travel to
detectors on either side of the patient. If the point of origin is(point) cm closer to one of the detectors, what is the difference in arrival times of the photons? (This could be used to give position information, but the time difference is small enough to make it difficult.)
