## Question Section 

A neutron generator uses an(alpha) source, such as radium, to bombard beryllium, inducing the reaction(^4He+^9Be) ->(^12C+n). Such neutron sources are called RaBe
sources, or PuBe sources if they use plutonium to get the(alpha) s. Calculate the energy output of the reaction in MeV.
ans_rule(40) MeV
