### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

half_life = 1.6*10**3
mass = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
M = 226

N = (mass/M)*Na
timeSI = (half_life*86400*365.25)

activitySI = (0.693*N)/(timeSI)
activity = (activitySI/c)
