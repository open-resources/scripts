to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
A(activity_1SI,Ci)(,^60Co) source used for cancer therapy is considered too weak to be useful when its activity falls to(activity_2SI,Ci). How long after its manufacture does this happen? 
ans_rule(40) years



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

activity_1SI = randrange(5500,6000,50)
activity_2SI = randrange(3000,3500,50)
half_life = 5.271

ratio = (activity_2SI/activity_1SI)
time = (-half_life*ln(ratio))/ln(2)
