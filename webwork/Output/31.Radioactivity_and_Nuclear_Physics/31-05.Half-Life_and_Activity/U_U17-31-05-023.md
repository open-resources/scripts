## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A nuclear physicist finds(mass) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;g<span> of(:^2 3 6 U) in a piece of uranium ore and assumes it is primordial since its half-life is(:2.3times 10^7) years.
 
Calculate the amount of(:^2 3 6U) that would had to have been on Earth when it formed(:4.5times 10^9) years ago for(mass) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;g<span> to be left today. 
ans_rule(40)(kg)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass = randrange(1,2,0.1)
t = 4.5*10**9
thalf = 2.3*10**7
Mo = ((mass*10**-6)*exp((0.693*t)/thalf))*10**-3
