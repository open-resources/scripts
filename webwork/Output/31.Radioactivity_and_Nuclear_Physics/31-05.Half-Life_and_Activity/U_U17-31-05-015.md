to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
The(beta^-) particles emitted in the decay of(, ^3H) (tritium) interact with matter to create light in a glow-in-the-dark exit sign. At the time of manufacture, such a sign contains(activity_1Ci,Ci) of(, ^3H).
a) What is the mass of the tritium?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

activity_1Ci = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(15,15.5,0.05))
activity_1 = (activity_1Ci*c*86400*365.25)          #Decays per year.
half_life = 12.33
M = 3.01605*1.6605*10**-27
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.5,8,1))

massSI = (activity_1*half_life*M)/(0.693)
mass = massSI*10**6
activity_2Ci = (activity_1Ci)*exp(-ln(2)*time/half_life)
