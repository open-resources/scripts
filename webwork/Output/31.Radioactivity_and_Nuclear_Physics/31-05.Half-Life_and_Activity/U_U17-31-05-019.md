from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,75,5))
ukg = 1/(1.6605*10**-27)
thalf238 = (4.47*10**9)*(86400*365.25)
decay = 4.27
cents = randrange(10,20,2)
Ro = ((0.693*(mass/1000)*ukg)/(238.050784*thalf238))/(3.7*10**10)
Energy = (mass/1000)*(1/238.050784)*ukg*(decay*10**6)*(1.602*10**-19)
value = Energy*((cents/100)/1000)*(1/3600)
