### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

abundance = 1.3*10**-12 
half_life = 5.73*10**3
mass = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
M = 12
N = (abundance)*(mass/M)*Na

timeSI = (half_life*86400*365.25)
activitySI = (0.693*N)/(timeSI)
