to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
A tree falls in a forest. How many years must pass before the(,^14C) activity in(mass_g,g) of the tree's carbon drops to(activity) decays per hour? Take the percent abundance of(,^14C) to be(1.30times 10^-10,%).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

activity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
abundance = 1.3*10**-12
half_life = 5730
half_life_hours = (half_life*365.25*24)
M = 12
mass_g = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))

particles = (abundance)*(mass_g/M)*(Na)
initial_activity = (ln(2)*particles)/(half_life_hours)
time = -(half_life/ln(2))*ln(activity/initial_activity)
