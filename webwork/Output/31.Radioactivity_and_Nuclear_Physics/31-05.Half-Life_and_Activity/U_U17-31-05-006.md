Cow's milk produced near nuclear reactors can be tested for as little as(activity,pCi) of(,^131I) to check for possible reactor leakage. What mass of(, ^131I) has this activity? 
ans_rule(40) (times 10^-18,g)

## I
of(,^131I) to check for possible reactor leakage. What mass of(, ^131I) has this activity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

activity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
activitySI = (activity*c)*10**-12
half_life = 8.04
M = 131

timeSI = (half_life*86400)
mass_g = (activitySI*M*timeSI)/(0.693*Na)
mass = mass_g*10**18
