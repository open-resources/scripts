## Question Section 

 
The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, 
with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is(mass,kg) of(:^2 3 8Pu), a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the(MeV,MeV,alpha) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of(:^2 3 8Pu) is(:thalf) years. 
a) What was the original activity of the(:Pu)?
ans_rule(40)(Bq)

## A
particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of(:^2 3 8Pu) is(:thalf) years. 
### Answer Section

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10, 15, 0.5))
atomsgrams = (6.022*10**23)/238.050784
thalf = 87.7
MeV = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.25, 5.75, 0.25))
y = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10, 20, 2))
Ro = (0.693*(mass*10**3)*atomsgrams)/(thalf*(3.156*10**7))
Po = ((MeV*10**6)*(1.602*10**-19)*(6.97*10**15))*10**-3
P = Po*exp(-(0.693*y)/thalf)
