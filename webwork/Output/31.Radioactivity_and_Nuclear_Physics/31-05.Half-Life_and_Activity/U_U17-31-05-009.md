## Question Section 

<b>
(,^50V) has one of the longest known radioactive half-lives. In a difficult experiment, a researcher found that the activity of(massSI,kg) of(,^50V) is(activitySI,Bq). What is the half-life in years? Take the molar mass of vanadium to be(50.94,fracgmol).
ans_rule(40)(times 10^17) years

## G
of(,^50V) is(activitySI,Bq). What is the half-life in years? Take the molar mass of vanadium to be(50.94,fracgmol).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

n = randrange(1, 3, 1)         #To avoid using unrelated randrange variables for activity and mass.

activitySI = sprintf("%0.2f", n*1.75)
massSI = sprintf("%0.2f", n)
mass_g = massSI*10**3
M = 50.94

timeSI = (0.693*Na*mass_g)/(activitySI*M)
half_life = (timeSI)/(86400*365.25)*10**-17
