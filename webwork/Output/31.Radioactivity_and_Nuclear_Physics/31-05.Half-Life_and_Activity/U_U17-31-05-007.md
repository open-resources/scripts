### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10           #Becquerel to curie.
Na = 6.022*10**23

activitySI = randrange(4000,4500,50)
half_life = 1.28*10**9
mass_body = randrange(100,150,5)
M = 40

timeSI = (half_life*86400*365.25)
mass_g = (activitySI*M*timeSI)/(0.693*Na)

mass = mass_g*10**3
ratio = (mass_g)/(mass_body)
