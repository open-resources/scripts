to see a table of the elements and their atomic masses, half-lives, and percent abundances.
A(,^60Co) source is labeled(activity1_mCi,mCi), but its present activity is found to be(activity2_Bqtimes 10^7,Bq).
a) What is the present activity in(mCi)? 
ans_rule(40)(mCi)

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3.7*10**10         #Becquerel to Curie.

activity1_mCi  = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,4.5,0.05))
activity2_Bq = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
activity2_BqSI  = activity2_Bq*10**7
half_life = 5.2714

activity2_mCi = (activity2_BqSI/c)*10**3
lambda = ln(2)/(half_life)
time = -(lambda**-1)*ln(activity2_mCi/activity1_mCi)
