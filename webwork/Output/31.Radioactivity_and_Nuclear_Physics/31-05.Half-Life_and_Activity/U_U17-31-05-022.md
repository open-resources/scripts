## Question Section 

The Galileo space probe was launched on its long journey past several planets in 1989, 
with an ultimate goal of Jupiter. Its power source is(mass) kg of(^238)Pu, a by-product of nuclear weapons plutonium production. Electrical energy is generated thermoelectrically from the heat produced when the(MeV)-MeV(alpha) particles emitted in each decay crash to a halt inside the plutonium and its shielding. The half-life of(^238)Pu is(thalf) years. 
a) What was the original activity of the(^238)Pu in becquerel? 
ans_rule(40) Bq
