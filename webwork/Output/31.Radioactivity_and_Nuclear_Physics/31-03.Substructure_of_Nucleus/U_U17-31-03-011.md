## Question Section 

![Particle Masses Table]("Particle_Masses_Tablea.png")

<center> 

<b>
What is the ratio of the velocity of a(energy,MeV)(beta)-ray to that of an(alpha)-particle with the same kinetic energy? This should confirm that(beta)'s travel much faster than(alpha)'s even when relativity is taken into consideration.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 2.998*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)
u = 1.6605*10**-27

mB = 9.1094*10**-31
mA = 4.002*u

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,5.5,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**6

gamma = (energySI)/(mB*c**2) + 1
velocityBSI = (c)*(1-gamma**-2)**(1/2)
velocityASI = ((2*energySI)/(mA))**(1/2)

ratio = (velocityBSI/velocityASI)
