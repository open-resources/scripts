### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 2.998*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)
u = 1.6605*10**-27

mB = 9.1094*10**-31
mA = 4.002*u

velocityB = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.996,0.998,0.005))
velocityBSI = (velocityB*c)
gamma = (1 - (velocityBSI/c)**2)**(-1/2)

energySI  = (gamma - 1)*(mB)*(c)**2
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-6
ratio = c/(velocityBSI)
