### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

distance1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
percent1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,92.5,0.5))
ratio1 = 1 - percent1*10**-2
x = (ln(0.001)/ln(0.1))*1.50
percent2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.1,0.15,0.05))
ratio2 = percent2*10**-2

n = ln(ratio2)/ln(ratio1)

distance2 = (n*distance1)
