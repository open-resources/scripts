A small sample of this isotope is labeled as having an activity of(activity,Ci). What is the mass of the(,^molar_massCa) in the sample? 
ans_rule(40)(times 10^9,kg)

## A
in the sample?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = 6.022*10**23
CB = 3.7*10**10

activity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
activitySI = (activity*CB)
molar_mass = 48
half_life = sprintf("%0.1f", 2)
half_lifeSI = (half_life*365.25*86400)*10**16
molar_mass = 48
molar_massSI = molar_mass*10**-3

massSI = (activitySI*molar_massSI*half_lifeSI)/(A*ln(2))
mass = massSI*10**-9
