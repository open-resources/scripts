## A
rays from a substance and sees evidence of a nucleus(radiustimes 10^-13,m) in radius. Find the atomic mass of such a nucleus.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

R = 1.2*10**-15

radius = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7,7.5,0.05))
radiusSI = radius*10**-13

A = (radiusSI/R)**3
