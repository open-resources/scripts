## Question Section 

<b>
A particle of ionizing radiation creates(n) ion pairs in the gas inside a Geiger tube as it passes through. What minimum energy was deposited, if(energy_per_pair,eV) is required to create each ion pair?
ans_rule(40)(eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

energy_per_pair = randrange(40,50,1)
n = randrange(4000,5000,100)
energy = (n*energy_per_pair)
