### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

energy_per_pair = randrange(40,50,1)
n = randrange(4000,5000,100)
energy = (n*energy_per_pair)
pressure = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.25,0.3,0.005))
pressureSI = pressure*10**5
temperatureSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(273,273,0.5))
volume = randrange(50,60,1)
volumeSI = volume*10**-6

energySI = (energy*e)
energy_fJ = energySI*10**15
delta_tempSI = (2/3)*(energySI*temperatureSI)/(pressureSI*volumeSI)
delta_temp = delta_tempSI*10**12
