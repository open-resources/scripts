<b>
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the(alpha) decay producing(,^228Ra). The parent nuclide is nearly(100,%) of the natural element and is found in gas lantern mantles and in metal alloys used in jets.(()(,^228Ra) is also radioactive.())
<center>(^a_bTh_c,,longrightarrow,, ^228_88Ra_140,,+,, ^4_2He_2)<center>
(a) =ans_rule(10)
(b) =ans_rule(10)
(c) =ans_rule(10)
