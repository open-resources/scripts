## Question Section 

<b>
Fill in the missing fields for the equation describing the(alpha) decay of(,^226Ra), another isotope in the decay series of(,^238U), first recognized as a new element by the Curies. Poses special problems because its daughter is a radioactive noble gas.
<center>(^226_88Ra_138,,longrightarrow,, ^a_bRn_c,,+,, ^4_2He_2)<center>
(a) =ans_rule(10)
(b) =ans_rule(10)
(c) =ans_rule(10)
