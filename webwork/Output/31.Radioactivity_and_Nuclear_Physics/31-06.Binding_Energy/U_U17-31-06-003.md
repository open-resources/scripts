is heaviest stable nuclide. Calculate its binding energy per nucleon, which is low compared with medium-mass nuclides.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Z = 83
N = 126

mass_bismuth = 208.980374
mass_proton = 1.007825
mass_neutron = 1.008665

binding_energy_per_A = (931.5)*(Z*mass_proton + N*mass_neutron - mass_bismuth)/(Z + N)
