The purpose of this problem is to show in three ways that the binding energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom is negligible compared with the masses of the proton and electron. 
a) Calculate the mass equivalent of the(binding_energy,eV) binding energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom. 
ans_rule(40)(u)

## A
Calculate the mass equivalent of the(binding_energy,eV) binding energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

c = 2.998*10**8
e = 1.602*10**-19

binding_energy = 13.6
mass_a = (1/931.5)*(binding_energy)*10**-6
mass_b = 0.000549
ratio = (binding_energy)/(5.11*10**5)
