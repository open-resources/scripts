## Question Section 

<b>
A physicist is watching a(15.0)-(kg) orangutan at a zoo swing lazily in a tire at the end of a rope. He (the physicist) notices that each oscillation takes(periodSI)(s) and hypothesizes that the energy is quantized.
a) What is the difference in energy in joules between allowed oscillator states?
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-34)(J)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

h = 6.63*10**-34

energy_bSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.75,5.25,0.25))
periodSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3.5,0.25))

frequencySI = periodSI**-1
energy_aSI = (frequencySI*h)*10**-34
n = (energy_bSI)/(frequencySI*h)*10**-34  #Subtraction of 1/2 is negligble.
