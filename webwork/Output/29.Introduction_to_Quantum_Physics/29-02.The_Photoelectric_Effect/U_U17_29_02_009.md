## Question Section 

<b>
What is the wavelength of EM radiation that ejects(energy,eV) electrons from calcium metal, given that the binding energy is(phi,eV)?
ans_rule(40)(nm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.75,2.25,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)

wavelengthSI = (h*c)/(energySI+phiSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**9
