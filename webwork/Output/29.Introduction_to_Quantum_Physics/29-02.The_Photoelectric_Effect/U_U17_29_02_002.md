## Question Section 

<b>
 
Find the longest-wavelength photon that can eject an electron from potassium, given that the binding energy is(energy,eV).
ans_rule(40)(nm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)

wavelengthSI = (h*c)/(energySI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**9
