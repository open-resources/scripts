## Question Section 

<b>
What is the maximum velocity of electrons ejected from a material by(wavelength,-nm) photons, if they are bound to the material by(phi,eV)? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31)(kg).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.5,5,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)
wavelength = randrange(75,100,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energySI  = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - phiSI
velocitySI = sqrt(2*energySI/massSI)
