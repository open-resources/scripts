### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

area = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))
areaSI = area*10**-6
intensity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.2,1.4,0.1))
intensitySI = intensity*10**3
phi= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)
wavelength = randrange(275,325,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

powerSI = (areaSI*intensitySI)
n = (powerSI*wavelengthSI)/(h*c)

energySI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - phiSI

electron_powerSI = (n*energySI)
electron_power = electron_powerSI*10**3
