## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the binding energy of electrons in aluminum, if the longest-wavelength photon that can eject them is(wavelength,nm).
ans_rule(40)(eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

wavelength = randrange(275,325,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energySI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI)
energy = (energySI/e)
