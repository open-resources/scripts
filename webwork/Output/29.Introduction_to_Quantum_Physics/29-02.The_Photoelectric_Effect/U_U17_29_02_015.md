## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Red light having a wavelength of(wavelength,nm) is projected onto magnesium metal to which electrons are bound by(phi,(eV). Calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.
ans_rule(40)(eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.5,4,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)
wavelength = randrange(675,725,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energySI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - phiSI
energy = (energySI/e)
