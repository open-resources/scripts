## Question Section 

<b>
A laser with a power output of(laser_power,mW) at a wavelength of(wavelength,nm) is projected onto calcium metal.
a) How many electrons per second are ejected?
ans_rule(40) electrons per second

## A
How many electrons per second are ejected?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

laser_power = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.75,2.25,0.05))
laser_powerSI  = laser_power*10**-3
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.75,3,0.05))
phiSI = (phi/e)
wavelength = randrange(375,425,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

n = (laser_powerSI*wavelengthSI)/(h*c)
electron_powerSI = (n)*((h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - phiSI)
electron_power = electron_power*10**3
