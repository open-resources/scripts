## Question Section 

<b>
 
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> What is the binding energy of electrons to a material from which(energy,-eV) electrons are ejected by(wavelength,-nm) EM radiation?
ans_rule(40)(eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.5,4,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)
wavelength = randrange(375,425,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

phiSI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI) - energySI
phi = (phiSI/e)
