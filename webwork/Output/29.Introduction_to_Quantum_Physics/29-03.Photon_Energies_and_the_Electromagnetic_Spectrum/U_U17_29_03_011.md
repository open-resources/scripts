## A
What is the ratio of power outputs,(fracAB), for microwave ovens(A), having a frequency of(frequency_low,MHz), and(B), having a frequency of(frequency_high,MHz), if they emit the same number of photons per second?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

frequency_high = randrange(2500,2600,10)
frequency_low = randrange(900,1000,10)


photons_ratio = frequency_high/frequency_low
power_ratio = frequency_low/frequency_high
