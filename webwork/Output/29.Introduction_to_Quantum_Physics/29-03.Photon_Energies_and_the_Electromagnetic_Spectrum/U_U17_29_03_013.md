### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.5,1,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**6
powerSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))

n = (powerSI/energySI)
radiusSI = 0.5*sqrt(n/pi)
radius = radiusSI*10**-3
