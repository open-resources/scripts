### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,1))
voltageSI = voltage*10**3

energy = voltageSI          #Divide and multiply by elementary charge.
energySI  =(e*voltageSI)
frequencySI = (energySI/h)
frequency = frequencySI*10**-18
