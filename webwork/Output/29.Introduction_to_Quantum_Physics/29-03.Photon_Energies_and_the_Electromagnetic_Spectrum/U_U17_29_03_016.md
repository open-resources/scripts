## Question Section 

<b>
How far away must you be from a(frequency,kHz) radio station with power(power,kW) for there to be only one photon per second per square meter? Assume no reflections or absorption, as if you were in deep outer space.
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

frequency = randrange(600,700,10)
frequencySI = frequency*10**3
power = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,55,1))
powerSI = power*10**3

energySI = (h*frequencySI)
n = (powerSI/energySI)
flux_per_secondSI = 0.5*sqrt(n/pi)
