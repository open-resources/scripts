## Question Section 

<b>
Find the energy of photons in radio waves from an FM station that has a(frequency,MHz) broadcast frequency.
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-7,eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

frequency = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(89.1,101.1,1))
frequencySI = frequency*10**6

energySI = (h*frequencySI)
energy = (energySI/e)*10**7
