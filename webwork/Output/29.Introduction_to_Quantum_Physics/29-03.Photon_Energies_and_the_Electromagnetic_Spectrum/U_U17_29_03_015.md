## Question Section 

<b>
How many x-ray photons per second are created by an x-ray tube that produces a flux of x-rays having a power of(powerSI,W)? Assume the average energy per photon is(energy,keV).
ans_rule(40)(fracphotonss)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(70,80,1))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**3
powerSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))

n = (powerSI/energySI)
