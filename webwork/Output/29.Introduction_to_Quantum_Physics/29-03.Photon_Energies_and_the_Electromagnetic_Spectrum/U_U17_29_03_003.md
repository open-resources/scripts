## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the frequency in hertz of a(energy,MeV) gamma-ray photon.
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**6

frequencySI = (energySI/h)
