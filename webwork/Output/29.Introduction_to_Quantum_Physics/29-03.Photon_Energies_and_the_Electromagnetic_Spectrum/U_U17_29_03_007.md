### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

energy_ionize = sprintf("%0.1f", 10)
frequency_a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
frequency_aSI = frequency_a*10**13
frequency_b = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.5,0.05))
frequency_bSI = frequency_b*10**20

energy_aSI = (h*frequency_aSI)
energy_a = (energy_aSI/e)
n_a = (energy_ionize/energy_a)

energy_bSI = (h*frequency_bSI)
energy_b = (energy_bSI/e)
n_b = (energy_ionize/energy_b)**-1
