### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

energy = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(47.5,52.5,0.5))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**9
massSI = 9.11*10**-31

gamma = (energySI)/(massSI*(c)**2)
momentumSI = (gamma*massSI*c)
momentum = momentumSI*10**17
wavelengthSI = (h)/(momentumSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**15
