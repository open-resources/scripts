## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A(54.0,eV) electron has a(wavelength,nm) wavelength. If such electrons are passed through a double slit and have their first maximum at an angle of(angle^circ), what is the slit separation?
ans_rule(40)(nm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)

angle = randrange(20,30,1)
rads = angle*(pi/180)
wavelength = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.16,0.17,0.005))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

separationSI = (wavelengthSI)/sin(rads)
separation = separationSI*10**9
