### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))
energySI = (energy*e)*10**12
massSI = 1.673*10**-27

gamma = (energySI)/(massSI*(c)**2)
momentumSI = (gamma*massSI*c)
momentum = momentumSI*10**16
wavelengthSI = (h)/(momentumSI)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**18
