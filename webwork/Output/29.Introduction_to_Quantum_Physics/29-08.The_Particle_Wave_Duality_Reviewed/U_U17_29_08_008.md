## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> An electron microscope passes(wavelength,pm) wavelength electrons through a circular aperture(diameter) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;m<span> in diameter. What is the angle between two just-resolvable point sources for this microscope?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

diameter = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.9,1.4,0.05))
diameterSI = diameter*10**-6
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-12

rads = 1.22*(wavelengthSI/diameterSI)
angle = rads*(180/pi)
