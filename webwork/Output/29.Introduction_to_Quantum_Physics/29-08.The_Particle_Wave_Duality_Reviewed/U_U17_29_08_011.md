## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

capacitance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.75,2.25,0.05))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-12
laser_power = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.25,2.75,0.05))
laser_powerSI = laser_power*10**-3
phi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,3,0.05))
phiSI = (phi*e)
wavelength = randrange(375,425,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energy_per_photonSI = (h*c)/(wavelengthSI)
nSI = (laser_powerSI/energy_per_photonSI)
n = nSI*10**-15
kinetic_energy_electronSI = (energy_per_photonSI - phiSI)
electron_powerSI = (nSI*kinetic_energy_electronSI)
electron_power = electron_powerSI*10**3
currentSI = (nSI*e)
timeSI = (kinetic_energy_electronSI*capacitanceSI)/(currentSI*e)
time = timeSI*10**12
