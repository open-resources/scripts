## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> One problem with x-rays is that they are not sensed. Calculate the temperature increase of a researcher exposed in a few seconds to a nearly fatal accidental dose of x-rays under the following conditions. The energy of the x-ray photons is(energy_per_photon,keV) and(photons_per_masstimes 10^13) of them are absorbed per kilogram of tissue, the specific heat of which is(heat_capacity,frackcalkgcdot ^circC). (Note that medical diagnostic x-ray machines cannot produce an intensity this great.)
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

energy_per_photon = randrange(175,225,5)
energy_per_photonSI = (energy_per_photon*e)*10**3
heat_capacity = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.820,0.870,0.005))
heat_capacitySI = 4186*heat_capacity
photons_per_mass = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,4.5,0.05))
photons_per_massSI = photons_per_mass*10**13

delta_tempSI = (energy_per_photonSI*photons_per_massSI)/(heat_capacitySI)
