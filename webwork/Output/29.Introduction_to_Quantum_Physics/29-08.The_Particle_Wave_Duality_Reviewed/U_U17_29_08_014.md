## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> The momentum of light is exactly reversed when reflected straight back from a mirror, assuming negligible recoil of the mirror. Suppose light of intensity(intensity,kWm^2) reflects from a mirror of area(areaSI,m^2).
a) Calculate the energy reflected in(timeSI,s)
ans_rule(40)(kJ)

## A
Calculate the energy reflected in(timeSI,s)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

areaSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.5,0.05))
intensity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))
intensitySI = intensity*10**3
timeSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))

energySI = (areaSI*intensitySI*timeSI)
energy = energySI*10**-3
momentumSI = (2*energySI)/(c)
forceSI = (momentumSI)/(timeSI)
