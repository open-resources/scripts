## A
Calculate the velocity of electrons that form the same pattern as(wavelength,nm) light when passed through a double slit. Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

wavelength = randrange(425,475,5)
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
momentumSI = (h)/(wavelengthSI)
velocitySI  = (momentumSI/massSI)

kinetic_energy_electronSI = 0.5*(massSI*(velocitySI)**2)
kinetic_energy_electron = kinetic_energy_electronSI*10**24
kinetic_energy_photonSI = (momentumSI*c)
kinetic_energy_photon = kinetic_energy_photonSI*10**19
