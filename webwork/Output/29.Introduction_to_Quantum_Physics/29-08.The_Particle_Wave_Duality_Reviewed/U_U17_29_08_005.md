## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b>
a) Calculate the amount of microwave energy in joules needed to raise the temperature of(mass_soupSI,kg) of soup from(temp_lowSI, ^circC) to(temp_highSI, ^circC). Assume the soup has the same specific heat as water.
b) What is the total momentum of all the microwave photons it takes to do this?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

heat_capacitySI = 4186
mass_soupSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
mass_XSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.5,0.05))
temp_lowSI = randrange(15,25,1)
temp_highSI = randrange(90,100,1)

delta_tempSI = (temp_highSI - temp_lowSI)
heatSI = (mass_soupSI*heat_capacitySI*delta_tempSI)
momentumSI = (heatSI/c)
velocitySI = (momentumSI/mass_XSI)
kinetic_energySI = 0.5*(mass_XSI*(velocitySI**2))
