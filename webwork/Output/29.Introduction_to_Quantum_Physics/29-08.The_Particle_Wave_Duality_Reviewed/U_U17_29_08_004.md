How many photons per second is this?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

delta_tempSI = randrange(40,50,1)
frequency = randrange(2500,2600,10)
frequencySI = frequency*10**6
heat_capacity = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.25,1.75,0.05))
heat_capacitySI = 4186*heat_capacity
massSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.5,1,0.05))
powerSI = randrange(850,950,10)

energy_per_photonSI = (h*frequencySI)
photons_per_secondSI = (powerSI/energy_per_photonSI)
energySI = (massSI*heat_capacitySI*delta_tempSI)
n = (energySI/energy_per_photonSI)
timeSI = (energySI/powerSI)
