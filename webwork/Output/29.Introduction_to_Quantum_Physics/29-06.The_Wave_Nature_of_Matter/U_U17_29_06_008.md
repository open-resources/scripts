## Question Section 

<b>
What is the wavelength of an electron accelerated through a(voltage,kV) potential, as in a TV tube? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(pm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(27.5,32.5,0.5))
voltageSI = voltage*10**3

wavelengthSI = (h)*(2*massSI*e*voltageSI)**-(1/2)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**12
