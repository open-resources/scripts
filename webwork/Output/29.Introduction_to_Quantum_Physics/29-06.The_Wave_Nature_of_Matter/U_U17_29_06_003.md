## Question Section 

<b>
At what velocity does a proton have a(wavelength,fm) wavelength (about the size of a nucleus)? Assume the proton is nonrelativistic. Take the mass of a proton to be(1.673times 10^-27,kg).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.673*10**-27
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.75,6.25,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-15

velocitySI = (h)/(massSI*wavelengthSI)
