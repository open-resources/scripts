## A
What is the proton's wavelength? Take the mass of a proton to be(1.673times 10^-27,kg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.673*10**-27
percent = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,25,0.5))
ratio = percent*10**-2

wavelengthSI = (h)/(massSI*ratio*c)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**15
energySI = 0.5*(massSI*(ratio*c)**2)
energy = energySI*10**12
voltageSI = (energySI/e)
voltage = voltageSI*10**-6
