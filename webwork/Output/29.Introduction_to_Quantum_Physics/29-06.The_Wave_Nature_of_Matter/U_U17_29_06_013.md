## Question Section 

<b>
Assuming it is nonrelativistic, calculate the velocity of an electron with a(wavelength,fm) wavelength.
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
wavelength = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.075,0.125,0.005))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-15

velocitySI = (h)/(massSI*wavelengthSI)
