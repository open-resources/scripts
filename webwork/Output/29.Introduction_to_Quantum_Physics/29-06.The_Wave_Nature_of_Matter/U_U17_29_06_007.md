## A
Find the velocity of a neutron that has a(wavelength,fm) wavelength (about the size of a nucleus). Assume the neutron is nonrelativistic. Take the mass of a neutron to be(1.675times 10^-27,kg).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.675*10**-27
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.75,6.25,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-15

velocitySI = (h)/(massSI*wavelengthSI)
energySI = 0.5*(massSI*(velocitySI**2))
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-6
