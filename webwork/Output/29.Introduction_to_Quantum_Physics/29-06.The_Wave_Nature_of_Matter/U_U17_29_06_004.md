### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.350,0.40,0.005))
wavelength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.5,8,0.05))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-2

velocitySI = (h)/(massSI*wavelengthSI)
velocity = velocitySI*10**32
