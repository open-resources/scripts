## Question Section 

<b>
What is the kinetic energy of an electron in a TEM having a(wavelength,nm) wavelength? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(keV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
wavelength = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.0075,0.0125,0.0005))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

energySI = (2*massSI)**-1*(h/wavelengthSI)**2
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-3
