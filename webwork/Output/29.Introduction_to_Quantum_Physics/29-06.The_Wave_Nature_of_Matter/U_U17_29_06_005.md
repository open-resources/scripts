## Question Section 

<b>
 
Find the wavelength of a proton moving at(percent) % of the speed of light. Take the mass of a proton to be(1.673times 10^-27,kg).
ans_rule(40)(fm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 1.673*10**-27
percent = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
ratio = percent*10**-2

wavelengthSI = (h)/(massSI*ratio*c)
wavelength = wavelengthSI*10**15
