## Question Section 

<b>
At what velocity will an electron have a wavelength of(wavelengthSI,m)? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
wavelengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1.25,0.05))

velocitySI = (h)/(massSI*wavelengthSI)
