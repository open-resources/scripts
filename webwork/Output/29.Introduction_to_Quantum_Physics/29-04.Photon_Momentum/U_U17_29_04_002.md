### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

wavelength = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.001,0.0125,0.0005))
wavelengthSI = wavelength*10**-9

momentumSI = (h/wavelengthSI)
momentum = momentumSI*10**23

energySI = (momentumSI*c)
energy = (energySI/e)*10**-6
