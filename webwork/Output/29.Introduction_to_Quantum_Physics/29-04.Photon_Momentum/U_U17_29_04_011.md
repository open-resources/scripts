## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Calculate the power of each headlight, if they exert a total force of(forcetimes 10^-2,N) on the car.
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34

force = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
forceSI = force*10**-2

powerSI = 0.5*(forceSI*c)
