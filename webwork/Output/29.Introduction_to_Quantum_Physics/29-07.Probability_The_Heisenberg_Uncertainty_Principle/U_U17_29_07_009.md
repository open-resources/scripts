<b>
What is the approximate uncertainty in the mass of a muon, as determined from its decay lifetime? Assume it's decay lifetime is(Utime) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;s<span>.
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-46,kg)

## E

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

Utime = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
UtimeSI = Utime*10**-6

UmassSI = (hbar/2)/(UtimeSI*c**2)
Umass = UmassSI*10**46
