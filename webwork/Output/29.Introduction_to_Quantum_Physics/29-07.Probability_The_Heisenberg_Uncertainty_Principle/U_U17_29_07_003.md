## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose the velocity of an electron in an atom is known to an accuracy of(Uvelocitytimes 10^3,ms) (reasonably accurate compared with orbital velocities). What is the electron's minimum uncertainty in position? Take the mass of an electron to be(9.11times 10^-31,kg).
ans_rule(40)(nm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

massSI = 9.11*10**-31
Uvelocity  = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(22.5,0.05))
UvelocitySI = Uvelocity*10**3

UpositionSI = (hbar/2)/(massSI*UvelocitySI)
Uposition = UpositionSI*10**9
