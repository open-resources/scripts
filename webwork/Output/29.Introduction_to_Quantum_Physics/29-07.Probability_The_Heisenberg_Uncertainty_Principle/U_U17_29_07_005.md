## Question Section 

<b>
A relatively long-lived excited state of an atom has a lifetime of(Utime,ms). What is the minimum uncertainty in its energy?
ans_rule(40)(times 10^-13,eV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
e = 1.6*10**-19
h = 6.63*10**-34
hbar = h/(2*pi)

Utime = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.75,3.25,0.05))
UtimeSI = Utime*10**-3

UenergySI = (hbar/2)/(UtimeSI)
Uenergy = (UenergySI/e)*10**13
