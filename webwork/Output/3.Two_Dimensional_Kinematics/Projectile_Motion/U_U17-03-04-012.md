## Question Section 

A rugby player passes the ball(d,m) across the field, where it is caught at the same height as it left his hand.
a) At what angle was the ball thrown if its initial speed was(v,ms), assuming that the smaller of the two possible angles was used?
b) What other angle gives the same range, and why would it not be used?
c) How long did this pass take?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(5,10,1)
v = randrange(10,15,1)
g = 9.8

A1 = 0.5*180/pi*arcsin(g*d/v**2)
A2 = 90-A1
vx = v*cos(A1*pi/180)
A3 = d/vx
