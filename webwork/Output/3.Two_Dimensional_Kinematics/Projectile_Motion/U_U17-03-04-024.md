## Question Section 

Suppose a soccer player kicks the ball from a distance(d,m) toward the goal. Find the initial speed of the ball if the peak of its arc just passes over the goal,(hg,m) above the ground, given the initial direction to be(deg^circ) above the horizontal.

## C
above the horizontal.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(26,33,1)
hg = randrange(2.1,2.5,0.1)
g = 9.8
deg = randrange(38,42,1)
rad = deg*pi/180

vo = sqrt((-0.5*g*d**2)/(((cos(rad))**2)*(hg-d*tan(rad))))
