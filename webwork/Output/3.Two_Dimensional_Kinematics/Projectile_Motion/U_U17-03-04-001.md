## Question Section 

a) Suppose you walk(x.0,m) straight west and then(y.0,m) straight south.
How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?
b) Suppose you walk(25.0,m) straight south and then(18.0,m) straight east.
How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

## A
Suppose you walk(x.0,m) straight west and then(y.0,m) straight south.
### Answer Section
## B
Suppose you walk(25.0,m) straight south and then(18.0,m) straight east.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
x = randrange(17,21,1)
y = randrange(23,27,1)
A1 = sqrt((x)**2+(y)**2)
A2 = atan(y/x)*180/pi
A3 = A1
A4 = atan(x/y)*180/pi
