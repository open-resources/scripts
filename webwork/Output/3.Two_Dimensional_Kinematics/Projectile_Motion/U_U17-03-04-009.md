## Question Section 

A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a(h,m) building and lands(d,m) from the base of the building. Ignore air resistance.
a) How long is the ball in the air?
b) What must have been the initial horizontal component of the velocity?
c) What is the vertical component of the velocity just before the ball hits the ground?
d) What is the velocity and angle of the ball just before it hits the ground?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = randrange(50,70,2)
d = randrange(90,110,4)
g = 9.8

t = sqrt(2*h/g)
b = d/t
c = g*t
d1 = sqrt(b**2+c**2)
d2 = arctan(c/b)*180/pi
