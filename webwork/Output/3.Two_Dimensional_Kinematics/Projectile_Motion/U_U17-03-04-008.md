## Question Section 

A ball is kicked with an initial velocity of(h,ms) in the horizontal direction and(v,ms) in the vertical direction.
a) At what speed does the ball hit the ground?
b) For how long does the ball remain in the air?
c)What maximum height is attained by the ball?

## A
At what speed does the ball hit the ground?
### Answer Section
## B
For how long does the ball remain in the air?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = randrange(15,17,1)
v = randrange(11,13,1)
g = 9.8

a = sqrt(h**2+v**2)
b = 2*v/g
c = v**2/(2*g)
