## Question Section 

An eagle is flying horizontally at a speed of(ve,ms) when the fish in her talons wiggles loose and falls into the lake(h,m) below. Calculate the velocity of the fish relative to the water when it hits the water.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
ve = randrange(2,4,1)
h = randrange(5,10,1)
g = 9.8

vy = sqrt(2*g*h)
vf = sqrt(ve**2+vy**2)
rad = arctan(vy/ve)
deg = rad*180/pi
