## Question Section 

A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of(vq,ms) when he throws a pass to a player(R,m) straight downfield.
a) If the ball is thrown at an angle of(deg^circ) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released, what is its initial speed relative to the ground?
b) How long does it take to get to the receiver?
c) What is its maximum height above its point of release?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
vq = randrange(1,3,1)
R = randrange(15,20,1)
deg =randrange(20,30,2)
rad = deg*pi/180
g = 9.8

vo = sqrt(R*g/(sin(2*rad)))
vx = vo*cosrad
t = R/vx
h = (vo*sinrad)**2/(2*g)
