## Question Section 

A projectile is launched at ground level with an initial speed of(i,ms) at an angle of(a^circ) above the horizontal. It strikes a target above the ground(t) seconds later. What are the x and y distances from where the projectile was launched to where it lands?
x =
y =

## C
above the horizontal. It strikes a target above the ground(t) seconds later. What are the x and y distances from where the projectile was launched to where it lands?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
i = randrange(40,60,2)
a = randrange(28,34,2)
A = a*pi/180
t = randrange(2,4,1)
g = 9.8

r = i**2/g*sin(2*A)
x = i*cos(A)*t
y = i*sin(A)*t-0.5*g*(t**2)
