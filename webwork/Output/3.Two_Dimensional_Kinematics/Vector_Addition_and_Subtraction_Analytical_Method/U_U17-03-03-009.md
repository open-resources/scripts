## Question Section 

Near the end of a marathon race, the first two runners are separated by a distance of(d1m). The front runner has a velocity of(vfms), and the second a velocity of(vsms).
a) What is the velocity of the second runner relative to the first?
b) If the front runner is(d2m) from the finish line, who will win the race, assuming they run at constant velocity?
Enter "first" for the first runner or "second" for the second runner.
ans_rule(40)
c) What distance ahead will the winner be when she crosses the finish line?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d1 = randrange(44,47,1)
vf = randrange(3.3,3.6,0.1)
vs = randrange(4.1,4.4,0.1)
d2 = randrange(248,251,1)

t = (d1+d2)/(vs)
A1 = vs-vf
A2 = second
A3 = d2-vf*t
