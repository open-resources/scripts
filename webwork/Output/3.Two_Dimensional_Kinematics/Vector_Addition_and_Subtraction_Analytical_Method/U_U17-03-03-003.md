## Question Section 

Prove that the trajectory of a projectile is parabolic, having the form(y=ax+bx^2). To obtain this expression, solve the equation(x=v_oxt) for(t) and substitute it into the expression for(y=v_oyt-(12)gt^2).
(These equations describe the(x) and(y) positions of a projectile that starts at the origin.) You should obtain an equation of the form(y=ax+bx^2) where(a) and(b) are constants.
When entering your answers use t for(theta), g for(g) and v for(v_o).
a =ans_rule(40)
b =ans_rule(40)
