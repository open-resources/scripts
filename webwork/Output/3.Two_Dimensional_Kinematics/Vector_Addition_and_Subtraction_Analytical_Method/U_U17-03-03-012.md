## Question Section 

A ship sets sail from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, heading due north at(vo,ms) relative to the water. The local ocean current is(vc,ms) in a direction(deg^circ) north of east. What is the velocity of the ship relative to the Earth?

## C
north of east. What is the velocity of the ship relative to the Earth?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
vo = randrange(6.5,7.5,0.1)
vc = randrange(1,1.8,0.1)
deg = randrange(37,43,1)

rad = deg*pi/180

x= vc*cos(rad)
y= vc*sin(rad)+vo
p1 = (x)**2
p2 = (y)**2
vbg = sqrt(p1+p2)
a = atan(y/x)*180/pi
