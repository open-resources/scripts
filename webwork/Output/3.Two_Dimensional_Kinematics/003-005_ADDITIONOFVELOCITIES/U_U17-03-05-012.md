## Question Section 

![Galaxies.]("NU_U17-03-05-012.png")

The great astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies are receding from our Milky Way Galaxy with velocities proportional to their distances. It appears to an observer on the Earth that we are at the center of an expanding universe. The above image illustrates this for five galaxies lying along a straight line, with the Milky Way Galaxy at the center. Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities:
a) relative to galaxy 2 and
Galaxy 1:
Galaxy 2:
Galaxy 3:
Galaxy 4:
Galaxy 5:
b) relative to galaxy 5.
Galaxy 1:
Galaxy 2:
Galaxy 3:
Galaxy 4:
Galaxy 5:
The results mean that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of expansion with the given information.

## A
relative to galaxy 2 and
### Answer Section
## B
relative to galaxy 5.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

A1 = -2300
A2 = 0
A3 = 2200
A4 = 5030
A5 = 8900

B1 = -11200
B2 = -8900
B3 = -6700
B4 = -3870
B5 = 0
