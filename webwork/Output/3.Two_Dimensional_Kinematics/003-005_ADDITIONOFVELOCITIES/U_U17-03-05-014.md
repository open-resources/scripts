## Question Section 

An athlete crosses a(w,m-wide) river by swimming perpendicular to the water current at a speed of(s,ms) relative to the water. He reaches the opposite side at a distance(d,m) downstream from his starting point.
a) How fast is the water in the river flowing with respect to the ground?
b) What is the speed of the swimmer with respect to a friend at rest on the ground?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
w = randrange(20,30,2)
s = randrange(0.3,0.7,0.1)
d = randrange(35,45,2)

drad = arctan(d/w)
vw = s*d/w
vf = sqrt(s**2+vw**2)
