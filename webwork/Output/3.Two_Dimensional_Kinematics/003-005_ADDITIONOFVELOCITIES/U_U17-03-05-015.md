## Question Section 

A ship sailing in the Gulf Stream is heading(wdeg^circ) west of north at a speed of(sw,ms) relative to the water. Its velocity relative to the Earth is(se,ms)(edeg^circ) west of north.
What is the velocity of the Gulf Stream?
(The velocity obtained is typical for the Gulf Stream a few hundred kilometers off the east coast of the United States.)

## C
west of north at a speed of(sw,ms) relative to the water. Its velocity relative to the Earth is(se,ms)(edeg^cirwest of north.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wdeg = randrange(24,26,1)
wdeg2 = wdeg+90
wrad2 = wdeg2*pi/180
sw = randrange(3.5,4.5,0.2)
se = randrange(4.5,5,0.1)
edeg = randrange(4,6,0.5)
edeg2 = edeg+90
erad2 = edeg2*pi/180

vx = -sw*cos(wrad2)+se*cos(erad2)
vy = -sw*sin(wrad2)+se*sin(erad2)
p1 = (vx)**2
p2 = (vy)**2
vw = sqrt(p1+p2)
arad = arctan(vy/vx)
adeg = arad*180/pi
