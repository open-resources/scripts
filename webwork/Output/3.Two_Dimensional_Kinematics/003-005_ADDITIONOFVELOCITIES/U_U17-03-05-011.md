## Question Section 

The velocity of the wind relative to the water is crucial to sailboats. Suppose a sailboat is in an ocean current that has a velocity of(s,ms) in a direction(b^circ) east of north relative to the Earth. It encounters a wind that has a velocity of(v,ms) in a direction of(a^circ) south of west relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the wind relative to the water?

## C
east of north relative to the Earth. It encounters a wind that has a velocity of(v,ms) in a direction of(a^cirsouth of west relative to the Earth. What is the velocity of the wind relative to the water?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
s = randrange(2.10,2.30,0.01)
b = randrange(27.0,33.0,1)
v = randrange(4.25,4.75,0.01)
a = randrange(47.0,53.0,1)
c = 90-b

x = -v*cos(a*pi/180)-s*cos(c*pi/180)
y = -v*sin(a*pi/180)-s*sin(c*pi/180)
p1 = (x)**2
p2 = (y)**2

A1 = sqrt(p1+p2)
A2 = atan(y/x)*180/pi
