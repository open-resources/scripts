## Question Section 

Suppose that you first walk( sw,m) in a direction( ds ^circ) south of west and then( nw,m) in a direction( dw ^circ) west of north.
a) How far are you from your starting point?
b) What is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
nw = randrange(10,15,1)
sw = randrange(18,24,1)
dw = randrange(15,25,2)
ds = randrange(35,40,2)

x = nw*sin(dw*pi/180)+sw*cos(ds*pi/180)
y = nw*cos(dw*pi/180)-sw*sin(ds*pi/180)
R = sqrt(x**2+y**2)
A = arctan(y/x)*180/pi
