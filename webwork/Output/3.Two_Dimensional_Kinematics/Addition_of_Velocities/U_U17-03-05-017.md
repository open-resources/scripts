## Question Section 

Solve the following problem using analytical techniques: Suppose you walk(y.0,m) straight north and then(x.0,m) straight west.
a) How far are you from your starting point?
b) What is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
y = randrange(23,27,1)
x = randrange(17,22,1)
A1 = sqrt((x)**2+(y)**2)
A2 = atan(x/y)*180/pi
