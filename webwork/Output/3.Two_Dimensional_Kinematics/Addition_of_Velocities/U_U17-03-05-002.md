![Figure 3.54.]("NU_U17-03-05-001.png")

Given that each block is(120,m) on a side, find the following for path B in the above image:
a) the total distance travelled,
b) the magnitude and direction of displacement from start to finish.

## A
the total distance travelled,
### Answer Section
## B
the magnitude and direction of displacement from start to finish.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

A1 = 1200
s = 120**2
h = 360**2
A2 = sqrt(s+h)
A3 = atan(360/120)*180/pi
