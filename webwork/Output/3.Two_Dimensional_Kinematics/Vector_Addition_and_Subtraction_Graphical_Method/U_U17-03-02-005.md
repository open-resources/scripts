## Question Section 

Suppose you first walk(12) m in a direction(20) degrees west of north and then(20) m in a direction(40) degrees south of west. How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position?
a) How far are you from your starting point,
ans_rule(40) m

## A
How far are you from your starting point,
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

a1 = ((-12)*(sin(20*pi/180)))-((20)*(cos(40*pi/180)))
a2 = ((12)*(cos(20*pi/180)))-((20)*(sin(40*pi/180)))
A1 = sqrt(((a1)**(2))+((a2)**(2)))
A2 = atan(a2/a1)*(180/pi)
