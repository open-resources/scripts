## Question Section 

<b>
A team of eight dogs pulls a sled with waxed wood runners on wet snow (mush!). The dogs have average masses of(19.0)(kg), and the loaded sled with its rider has a mass of(210)(kg).
a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of(fa)(N) backward on the snow. 
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)

## A
Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of(fa)(N) backward on the snow. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

ms = 210
us = 0.14
g = 9.80
mt = 362
fa = 185
accelerationa = ((8*fa)/(mt))-((us*g)*(ms/mt))
uk = 0.1
accelerationb = ((8*fa)/(mt))-((uk*g)*(ms/mt))
case1 = 980
case2 = 945
