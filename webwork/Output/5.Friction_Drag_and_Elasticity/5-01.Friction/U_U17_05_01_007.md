![Figure Skaters.]("NU_U17_05_01_007NU_U17_05_01_007.png")

<b>
Consider the(mass)(kg) ice skater being pushed by two others shown in the above figure. The coefficient of static friction between the steel blades of her skates and the ice is(us) and the coefficient of kinetic friction is(uk).
a) Find the magnitude of the total force exerted on her by the others, given that the magnitudes(F_1) and(F_2) are(F1)(N) and(F2)(N), respectively.
ans_rule(40)(N)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(50.0,70.0,0.1))
g = 9.8
F1 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(20.0,70.0,0.1))
F2 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(30.0,50.0,0.1))
us = 0.04
uk = 0.02
FT = sqrt((F1)**2+(F2)**2)
direction = arctan(F2/F1)*180/pi
accelerationc = ((FT)/(mass))-((g)*(us))
accelerationd = (FT/mass)-((g)*(uk))
