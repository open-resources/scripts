<b>
A contestant in a winter sporting event pushes a(mass)-(kg) block of ice across a frozen lake as shown in part (a) the above figure.
(a) Calculate the minimum force(F) he must exert to get the block moving.
ans_rule(40)(N)

## A
the above figure.
### Answer Section
## G
block of ice across a frozen lake as shown in part (a) the above figure.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
## VARIABLES
mass = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20.0,40.0,0.1))
g = 9.80
us = 0.1
uk = 0.03
angle = 25.0
rads = angle*pi/180

## CALCLUATIONS
forcea = (us*mass*g)/(cos(rads)-(us)*sin(rads))
accelerationa = ((forcea)/(mass))*(cos(rads)-(uk)*sin(rads))-((uk)*(g))
forceb = ((us)*(mass)*(g))/(cos(rads)+(us)*sin(rads))
accelerationb = ((forceb)/(mass))*(cos(rads)+(uk)*sin(rads))-((uk)*(g))
