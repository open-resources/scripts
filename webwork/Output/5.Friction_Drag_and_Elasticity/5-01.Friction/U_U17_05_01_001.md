## Question Section 

<b>
A physics major is cooking breakfast when he notices that the frictional force between his steel spatula and his Teflon frying pan is only(f,N). Knowing the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two materials, he quickly calculates the normal force.
What is it?
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f = randrange(0.117,0.999,0.019)
uk = 0.04
N = f/uk
