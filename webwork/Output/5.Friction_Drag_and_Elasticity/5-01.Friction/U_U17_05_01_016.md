## Question Section 

<b>
A freight train consists of two(trainmtimes 10^5)(kg) engines and(45) cars with average masses of(caramtimes 10^5)(kg) . 
a) What force must each engine exert backward on the track to accelerate the train at a rate of(alphatimes 10^-2)(ms^2) if the force of friction is(foftimes 10^5)(N), assuming the engines exert identical forces? This is not a large frictional force for such a massive system. Rolling friction for trains is small, and consequently trains are very energy-efficient transportation systems.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
trainm = randrange(5.60,9.99,0.29)
trainmt = trainm*(10**5)
caram = randrange(1.80,5.59,0.13)
carmt = caram*(10**5)
alpha = randrange(4.33,6.03,0.08)
accelerate = alpha*(10**-2)
fof = randrange(5.80,8.59,0.09)
fofN = fof*(10**5)

TotalMass = 2*(trainmt)+45*(carmt)
TotalForce = ((TotalMass*accelerate)+fofN)/2

carma = 8*(carmt*accelerate)
frictionalforce = (8*fofN)/47
Fcoupling = carma+frictionalforce
