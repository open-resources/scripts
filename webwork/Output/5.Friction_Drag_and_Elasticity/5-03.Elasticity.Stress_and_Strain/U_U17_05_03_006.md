## Question Section 

<b>
A(Lo)(m) tall hollow aluminum flagpole is equivalent in strength to a solid cylinder(dcm)(cm) in diameter. A strong wind bends the pole as much as would a horizontal force of(F)(N) exerted at the top. How far to the side does the top of the pole flex?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lo = randrange(21.00,69.00,4.0)
dcm = randrange(4.00,9.99,0.10)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
F = randrange(750,980,4.00)
S = 2.5*(10**10)
x = (1/S)*(F/A)*(Lo)
