## Question Section 

<b>
A disk between vertebrae in the spine is subjected to a shearing force of(F)(N). Find its shear deformation, taking it to have a shear modulus of(1.00times 10^9)(Nm^2). The disk is equivalent to a solid cylinder(Locm)(cm) high and(dcm)(cm) in diameter. 
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Locm = randrange(0.60,0.90,0.08)
Lo = Locm/100
dcm = randrange(2.00,6.84,0.8)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
S = 1*(10**9)
F = randrange(519,810,12.0)
x = (1/S)*(F/A)*Lo
