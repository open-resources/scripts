## Question Section 

<b>
The “lead” in pencils is a graphite composite with a Young's modulus of about(1.00times 10^9)(Nm^2). Calculate the change in length of the lead in an automatic pencil if you tap it straight into the pencil with a force of(F)(N). The lead is(dmm)(mm) in diameter and(Lomm)(mm) long. 
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lomm = randrange(58.00,99.00,1.0)
Lo = Lomm/1000
dmm = randrange(0.50,0.90,0.1)
dm = dmm/1000
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
F = randrange(2.00,9.00,1.00)
Y = 1*(10**9)
L = (1/Y)*(F/A)*(Lo)
