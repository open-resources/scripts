The pole in the above figure is at a right angle bend in a power line and is therefore subjected to more shear force than poles in straight parts of the line. The tension in each line is(titimes 10^4)(N), at the angles shown. The pole is(height)(m) tall, has a(d)(cm) diameter, and can be considered to have half the stiffness of hardwood. 
a) Calculate the compression of the pole caused by the power lines (excluding the guy wire). 
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
Calculate the compression of the pole caused by the power lines (excluding the guy wire). 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
## VARIABLES
ti = randrange(3,4,0.1)
tension = ti*10**4
g = 9.80
Y = 0.5*15*10**9
S = 0.5*10*10**9
d = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(15,20,0.1))
r = 0.5*d/100
height = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(15,30,0.1))
degreesguy = 30
radsguy = degreesguy*pi/180
degreeswires = 80
radswires = degreeswires*pi/180

##CALCULATIONS
heightchange = (2*(height)*(tension)*cos(radswires))/((Y)*pi*(r)**2)
forceshear = sqrt(2)*(tension)*sin(radswires)
sheardeform = ((forceshear)*(height))/((S)*pi*(r)**2)
tensionguy = 2*sqrt(2)*(tension)*sin(radswires)
