## Question Section 

<b>
The leftmost wire supporting a traffic light makes an angle(degree^circ) below the horizontal with the top of its pole and carries a tension of(T,N). The(Lo,m) tall hollow aluminum pole is equivalent in strength to a(dcm,cm) diameter solid cylinder. 
a) How far is the pole bent to the side? 
ans_rule(40)(m)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

degree = randrange(29.0,39.0,1.0)
rads = degree*(3.14159265/180)
Lo = randrange(12.60,40.90,1.2)
T = randrange(101,199,2.00)
Fa = T*cos(rads)
Fb = T*sin(rads)
dcm = randrange(2.10,5.84,0.07)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = 3.14159265*r2
S = 2.5*(10**10)
x = (1/S)*(Fa/A)*Lo
Y = 7*(10**10)
L = (Lo/Y)*(Fb/A)
