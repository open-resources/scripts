## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the force a piano tuner applies to stretch a steel piano wire(Lmm)(mm), if the wire is originally(dmm)(mm) in diameter and(Lo)(m) long.
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lo = randrange(1.20,2.10,0.01)
dmm = randrange(0.500,0.99,0.020)
dm = dmm/1000
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
Y = 2.10*(10**11)
Lmm = randrange(4.00,9.00,1.0)
L = Lmm/1000
F = (L*Y*A)/Lo
