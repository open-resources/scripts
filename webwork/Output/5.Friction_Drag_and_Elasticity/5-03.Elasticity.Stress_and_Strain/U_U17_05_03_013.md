## Question Section 

<b>
A farmer making grape juice fills a glass bottle to the brim and caps it tightly. The juice expands more than the glass when it warms up, in such a way that the volume increases by(percent)(%) (that is,(Î”VV_circ) =(VVo)) relative to the space available.
Calculate the force exerted by the juice per square metre if its bulk modulus is(Bulktimes 10^9)(Nm^2).
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)

## C
=(VVo)) relative to the space available.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(0.1,0.6,0.1)
VVo = percent/100
Bulk = randrange(1.3,1.9,0.1)
B = Bulk*(10**9)
FA = B*VVo
