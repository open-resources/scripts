## Question Section 

<b>
As an oil well is drilled, each new section of drill pipe supports its own weight and that
of the pipe and drill bit beneath it. Calculate the stretch in a new(Lo)(m) length of
steel pipe that supports(km)(km) of pipe having a mass of(mkgm)(kgm) and a(mbit)(kg) drill bit. The pipe is equivalent in strength to a solid cylinder(dcm)(cm) in diameter.
ans_rule(40)(m)

## G
drill bit. The pipe is equivalent in strength to a solid cylinder(dcm)(cm) in diameter.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lo = randrange(2.00,9.00,1.0)
mkgm = randrange(15.00,30.00,2.00)
mp = Lo*mkgm
km = randrange(2.00,7.00,1.00)
meter = km*1000
mkm = meter*mkgm
mbit = randrange(90.00,130.00,11.00)
m = mp+mkm+mbit
g = 9.8
F = m*g
dcm = randrange(4.00,9.99,0.10)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
Y = 2.10*(10**11)
L = (1/Y)*(F/A)*(Lo)
