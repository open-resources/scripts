## Question Section 

<b>
A vertebra is subjected to a shearing force of(F)(N). Find the shear deformation, taking the vertebra to be a cylinder(Locm)(cm) high and(dcm)(cm) in diameter.
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Locm = randrange(3.20,5.90,0.04)
Lo = Locm/100
dcm = randrange(5.00,9.90,0.17)
dm = dcm/100
r = dm/2
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
S = 8*(10**10)
F = randrange(468,777,13.00)
x = (1/S)*(F/A)*Lo
