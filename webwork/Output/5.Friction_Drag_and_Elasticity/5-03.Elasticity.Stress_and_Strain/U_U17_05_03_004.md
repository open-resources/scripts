## Question Section 

<b>
TV broadcast antennas are the tallest artificial structures on Earth. In 1987, a(mp)(kg)
physicist placed himself and(me)(kg) of equipment at the top of one(Lo)(m) high antenna to perform gravity experiments. By how much was the antenna compressed,
if we consider it to be equivalent to a steel cylinder(r)(m) in radius?
ans_rule(40)(m)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lo = randrange(558.00,899.00,27.0)
mp = randrange(55.00,89.00,7.0)
me = randrange(399.00,546.00,9.0)
g = 9.8
r = randrange(0.140,0.190,0.012)
r2 = r**2
A = pi*r2
F = (mp+me)*g
Y = 2.10*(10**11)
L = (1/Y)*(F/A)*(Lo)
