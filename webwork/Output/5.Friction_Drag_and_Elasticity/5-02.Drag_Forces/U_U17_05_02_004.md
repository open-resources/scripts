## Question Section 

<b>
To maintain a constant speed, the force provided by a car's engine must equal the drag force plus the force of friction of the road (the rolling resistance). 
a) What are the drag forces at(v1km)(kmh) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is(DA1)(m^2)).
b) What are the drag forces at(v2km)(kmh) for a Toyota Camry? (Drag area is(DA1)(m^2)) 
c) What is the drag force at(v1km)(kmh) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is(DA2)(m^2))
d) What is the drag force at(v2km)(kmh) for a Hummer H2? (Drag area is(DA2)(m^2))
