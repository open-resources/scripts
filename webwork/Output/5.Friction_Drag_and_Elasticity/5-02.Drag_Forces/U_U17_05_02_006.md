## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the speed a spherical rain drop would achieve falling from(xkm)(km).
a) Assume that there is no air drag.
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## A
Assume that there is no air drag.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
xkm = randrange(3.00,9.00,0.81)
x = xkm*1000
g = 9.8
v = sqrt(2*g*x)
dmm = randrange(2.00,7.00,0.28)
rmm = dmm/2
r = rmm/1000
A = pi*((r)**2)
C = 0.45
p = 1.21
density = 1.00
m = 1000*(4/3)*pi*((r)**3)
vt = sqrt((2*m*g)/(p*C*A))
