## Question Section 

<b>
A(ms)(g) squirrel with a cross-sectional area of(A)(m^2) falls from a(x)-(m)-high tree to the ground. Estimate its terminal speed. (Use the drag coefficient for a horizontal skydiver).
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## G
squirrel with a cross-sectional area of(A)(m^2) falls from a(x)-(m)-high tree to the ground. Estimate its terminal speed. (Use the drag coefficient for a horizontal skydiver).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
ms = randrange(400.00,600.00,29.00)
mskg = ms/1000
mp = ms/10
A = randrange(0.0113,0.0999,0.02)
C = 1.00
g = 9.80
p = 1.21
vt = sqrt((2*mskg*g)/(p*C*A))
x = randrange(2.43,9.99,0.22)
v2 = sqrt(2*g*x)
