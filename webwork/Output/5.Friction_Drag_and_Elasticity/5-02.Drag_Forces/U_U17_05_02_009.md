## Question Section 

<b>
Stokes's law describes sedimentation of particles in liquids and can be used to determine viscosity. Particles in liquids achieve terminal speed quickly. One can measure the time it takes for a particle to fall a certain distance and then use Stokes's law to calculate the viscosity of the liquid. Suppose a steel ball bearing (density(densetimes 10^3)(kgm^3), diameter(dmm)(mm)) is dropped in a container of motor oil. It takes(t)(s) to fall a distance of(d)(m). Calculate the viscosity of the oil.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
dense = randrange(5.09,9.99,0.15)
density = dense*1000
dmm = randrange(2.00,8.00,0.09)
rmm = dmm/2
r = rmm*(10**-3)
r3 = r**3
m = density*(4/3)*pi*r3
t = randrange(11,19,1)
d = randrange(0.20,0.90,0.1)
v = d/t
g = 9.80
n = (m*g)/(6*pi*r*v)
