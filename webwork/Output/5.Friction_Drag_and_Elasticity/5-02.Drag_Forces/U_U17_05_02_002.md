## Question Section 

<b>
A(ml)-(kg) skydiver and a(mh)-(kg) skydiver jump from an airplane at an altitude of(d)(m), both falling in the pike position. Assume their cross-sectional areas are both(A)(m^2) and calculate their terminal speeds. 
a) How long will it take for the first skydiver with mass(ml)(kg) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)? 
b) How long will it take for the second skydiver with mass(mh)(kg) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)?

## A
How long will it take for the first skydiver with mass(ml)(kg) to reach the ground (assuming the time to reach terminal speed is small)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
ml = randrange(40.00,60.00,3.2)
mh = randrange(65.00,90.00,3.2)
A = randrange(0.110,0.230,0.02)
C = 0.70
g = 9.80
p = 1.21
vtl = sqrt((2*ml*g)/(p*C*A))
vth = sqrt((2*mh*g)/(p*C*A))
d = randrange(5999,7999,122.00)
tl = d/vtl
th = d/vth
