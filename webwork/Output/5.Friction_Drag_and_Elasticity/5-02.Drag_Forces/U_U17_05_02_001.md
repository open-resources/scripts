## Question Section 

<b>
The terminal speed of a person falling in air depends upon the weight and the area of the person facing the fluid.
Find the terminal speed of a(m)-(kg) skydiver falling in a pike (headfirst) position with a cross-sectional area of(A)(m^2).
ans_rule(40)(kmh)

## G
skydiver falling in a pike (headfirst) position with a cross-sectional area of(A)(m^2).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(50.00,90.00,3.2)
A = randrange(0.110,0.230,0.02)
C = 0.70
g = 9.80
p = 1.21
vt = sqrt((2*m*g)/(p*C*A))
vconversion = vt*(3600/1000)
