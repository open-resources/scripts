## Question Section 

Point charges of(q1) μC and(-q2) μC are placed(r1) m apart.
a) Where can a third charge be placed so that the net force on it is zero?
ans_rule(40) m
b) What if both charges are positive?
ans_rule(40) m

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

q1 = randrange(5.00,9.99,0.09)
q2 = randrange(1.00,4.99,0.03)
r1 = randrange(0.022,0.499,0.005)
d1 = (sqrt((q2)/(q1))*r1)/(1-(sqrt((q2)/q1)))
d2 = (sqrt((q2)/(q1))*r1)/(1+sqrt(q2/q1))
