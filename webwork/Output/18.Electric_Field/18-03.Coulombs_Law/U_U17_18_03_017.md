## Question Section 

Two point charges q1 and q2 are(r2) m apart, and their total charge is(q1q2) μC
a) If the force of repulsion between them is(F) N, what are magnitudes of the two charges?
 μC
b) If one charge attracts the other with a force of(0.525) N, what are the magnitudes of the two charges?
 μC

## A
If the force of repulsion between them is(F) N, what are magnitudes of the two charges?
### Answer Section
## B
If one charge attracts the other with a force of(0.525) N, what are the magnitudes of the two charges?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

q1q2 = 20
q = q1q2*(10**-6)
r = 3
r2 = r**2
F = 0.075
Q1a = 15
Q2b = -15
