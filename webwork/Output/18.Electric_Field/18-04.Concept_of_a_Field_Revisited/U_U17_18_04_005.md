## Question Section 

Calculate the initial (from rest) acceleration of a proton in a(Eatimes 10^6) NC electric field (such as created by a research Van de Graaff).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Ea = randrange(1.11,7.99,0.33)
E = Ea*(10**6) 
q = 1.6*(10**-19)   
m = 1.67*(10**-27) 
acceleration =(q*E)/m
