 N East

## A
Find the direction and magnitude of an electric field that exerts a(Fatimes 10^-17) N westward force on an electron.
### Answer Section
## B
What magnitude and direction force does this field exert on a proton?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Fa = randrange(1.02,9.99,0.19) 
F = Fa*(10**-17)
q = 1.6*(10**-19)
E = F/q
Fb = (q*E)*(1*(10**17))
