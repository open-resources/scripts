## Question Section 

a) What magnitude point charge creates a(Ea) NC electric field at a distance of(ra) m?
ans_rule(40) C
b) How large is the field at(rb) m?
ans_rule(40) NC

## A
What magnitude point charge creates a(ENC electric field at a distance of(rm?
### Answer Section
## B
How large is the field at(rm?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Ea = randrange(10000.03,20000.999,30.19) 
ra = randrange(0.129,0.981,0.016)
ra2 = ra**2   
k = 8.99*10**9
Q = (ra2*Ea)/k
rb = randrange(10.12,40.98,0.97)
rb2 = rb**2
Eb = (k*Q)/rb2
