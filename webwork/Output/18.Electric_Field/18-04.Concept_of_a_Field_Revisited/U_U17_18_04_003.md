## Question Section 

Calculate the magnitude of the electric field(r) m from a point charge of(q1) mC (such as found on the terminal of a Van de Graaff).
ans_rule(40) NC



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1.01,9.00,0.37)
r2 = r**2 
q1 = randrange(1.00,9.99,0.18)   
q = q1*(10**-3) 
k = 8.99*(10**9)
E = (k*q)/r2
