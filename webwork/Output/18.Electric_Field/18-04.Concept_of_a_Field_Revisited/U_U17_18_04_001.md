## Question Section 

What is the magnitude and direction of an electric field that exerts a(f1times 10^-5) N upward force on a(q1) Î¼C charge?
ans_rule(40) NC downward



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f1 = randrange(5.01,10.04,0.25)
F = f1*(10**-5) 
q1 = randrange(-4.99,-1.02,0.07)   
q = q1*(10**-6) 
E = F/q
