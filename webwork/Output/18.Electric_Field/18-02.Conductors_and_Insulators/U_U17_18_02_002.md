## Question Section 

An amoeba has(atimes 10^16) protons and a net charge of(c) pC. 
a) How many fewer electrons are there than protons? 
ans_rule(40) fewer electrons
b) If you paired them up, what fraction of the protons would have no electrons?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(1.0, 6.0, 0.5) 
Np = a*(10**16)
c = randrange(0.01, 2.0, 0.2)   
Q = c*10**-12
qe = 1.60e-19
Npe = Q/qe
f = Npe/Np
