## Question Section 

Suppose a speck of dust in an electrostatic precipitator has(atimes 10^12) protons in it and has a net charge of(c) nC (a very large charge for a small speck). How many electrons does it have?
ans_rule(40)

## C
nC (a very large charge for a small speck). How many electrons does it have?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = 1.00
Np = a*10**12
c = randrange(-7.00,-5.00, 0.1)
Q = c*10**-9
qe = 1.6e-19   
Ne = (Np)-(Q/qe)
