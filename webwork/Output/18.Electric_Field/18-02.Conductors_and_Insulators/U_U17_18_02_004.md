## Question Section 

What net charge would you place on a(m) g piece of sulfur if you put an extra electron on(btimes 10^12) of its atoms? 
(Sulfur has an atomic mass of(32.1).)
ans_rule(40) C



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(102.1,203.5,6.25)
b = 1.00
c = 1*(10**12)
n = m/32.1
qe = -1.6*(10**-19)
Ns = n*(6.022e23)
Q = (Ns*qe)/c
