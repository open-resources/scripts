## Question Section 

If(atimes 10^20) electrons move through a pocket calculator during a full day's operation, determine the magnitude of the charge that moved through it. 
ans_rule(40)C



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(1.10,1.90,0.03)
N = a*10**20
qe = 1.6e-19      
Q = (N)*(qe)
