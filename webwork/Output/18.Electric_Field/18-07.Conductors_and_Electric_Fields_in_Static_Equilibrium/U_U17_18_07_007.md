## Question Section 

![Positions of point charges.]("NU_U17_18_07_005.png")

Find the electric field at the location of(q_a), given that(q_b=q_c=q_d=+2.00,nC),(q=-1.00,nC), and the square is(20.0,cm) on a side.
ans_rule(40) NC



## Answer Section

q = 2.00
Q = q*10**-9
r = 0.2
rq = r/2*sqrt(2)
rd = sqrt(2*(r**2))
rq = rd/2
E = 412
