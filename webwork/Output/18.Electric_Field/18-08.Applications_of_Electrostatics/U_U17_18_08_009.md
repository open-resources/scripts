## Question Section 

The practical limit to an electric field in air is about(Eatimes 10^6) NC . Above this strength, sparking takes place because air begins to ionize and charges flow, reducing the field. 
Calculate the distance a free proton must travel in this field to reach(percentconstant) % of the speed of light, starting from rest. 
ans_rule(40) m



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = 3.00*(10**8)
percentconstant = randrange(2.00,7.99,0.28)
percent = percentconstant/100
v2 = (v*percent)**2
m = 1.67*(10**-27)
q = 1.60*(10**-19)
Ea = randrange(1.01,9.99,0.12)
E = Ea*(10**6)
x = (v2*m)/(2*q*E)
