## Question Section 

A wrecking yard inventor wants to pick up cars by charging a(d) m diameter ball and inducing an equal and opposite charge on the car. If a car has a(m) kg mass and the ball is to be able to lift it from a distance of(r1) m: 
a) What minimum charge must be used? 
ans_rule(40) C
b) What is the electric field near the surface of the ball?
ans_rule(40) NC

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.201,0.999,0.027)
r = d/2
r2 = r**2
m = randrange(1003.00,2999.00,135.00)
k = 8.99*(10**9)
g = 9.80
r1 = randrange(1.03,9.99,0.34)
q = r1*((m*g)/k)**(1/2)
E = (k*q)/r2
