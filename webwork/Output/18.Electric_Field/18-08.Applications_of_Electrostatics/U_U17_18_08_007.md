## Question Section 

Calculate the angular velocity(omega) of an electron orbiting a proton in the hydrogen atom, given the radius of the orbit is(rtimes 10^-10,m). You may assume that the proton is stationary and the centripetal force is supplied by Coulomb attraction.

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(0.123,0.999,0.019)
r2 = r*(10**-10)
r3 = r2**3
k = 8.99*(10**9)
m = 9.11*(10**-31)
q = 1.60*(10**-19)
q1 = q**2
w = (k*q1)/(m*r3)
w1 = w**(1/2)
