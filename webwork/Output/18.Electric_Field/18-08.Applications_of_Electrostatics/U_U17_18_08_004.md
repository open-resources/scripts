## Question Section 

Earth has a net charge that produces an electric field of approximately(E) NC downward at its surface.
a) What is the magnitude and sign of the excess charge, noting the electric field of a conducting sphere is equivalent to a point charge at its centre? 
ans_rule(40) C
b) What acceleration will the field produce on a free electron near Earth's surface? 
 (upwards)
c) What mass object with a single extra electron will have its weight supported by this field?
 kg

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
E = randrange(101,302,2.00)
r = (6.37*(10**6))**2 
k = 8.99*(10**9)
Qa = (r*E)/k
q = -1.6*(10**-19)
g = 9.80
mb = 9.11*(10**-31)
acceleration = (q*E)/mb
massc = ((q*E)/g)*(1*(10**18))
