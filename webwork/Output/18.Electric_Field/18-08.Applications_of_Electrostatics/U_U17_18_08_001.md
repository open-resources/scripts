## Question Section 

a) What is the electric field(r) m from the centre of the terminal of a Van de Graaff with a(q1) mC charge, noting that the field is equivalent to that of a(q2,muC) charge at the centre of the terminal?
ans_rule(40) NC
b) At this distance, what force does the field exert on a(q2) μC charge on the Van de Graaff's belt?
ans_rule(40) N

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1.08,9.99,0.67)
r2 = r**2 
q1 = randrange(1.00,9.99,0.98)   
Q = q1*(10**-3) 
k = 8.99*(10**9)
E = (k*Q)/r2
q2 = randrange(1.00,9.99,0.14)
Qq = q2*(10**-6)
F = E*Qq
