## Question Section 

An electron has an initial velocity of(votimes 10^6) ms in a uniform(Etimes 10^5) NC strength electric field. The field accelerates the electron in the direction opposite to its initial velocity. 
a) How far does the electron travel before coming to rest? 
ans_rule(40) m
b) How long does it take the electron to come to rest? 
ans_rule(40) s
c) What is the electron's velocity when it returns to its starting point?
ans_rule(40) ms

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
vo = randrange(2.00,9.99,0.28)
vo1 = vo*(10**6)
vo2 = vo1**2
k = 8.99*(10**9)
m = 9.11*(10**-31)
q = 1.60*(10**-19)
E = randrange(1.99,8.99,0.12)
E1 = E*(10**5)
x = (vo2*m)/(2*q*E1)
t = (vo1*m)/(q*E1)
v = (2*q*E1*x)/m
v1 = -v**(1/2)
