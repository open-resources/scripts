## Question Section 

Point charges of(q1,muC) and(q2,muC) Î¼C are placed(d,m) apart.
a) At what point along the line between them is the electric field zero?
ans_rule(40) m
b) What is the electric field halfway between them?
ans_rule(40) NC

## A
At what point along the line between them is the electric field zero?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the electric field halfway between them?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

d = 0.500
d2 = d**2
q2 = 45.00
Qq2 = q2*(10**-6)
q1 = 25.00
Qq1 = q1*(10**-6)
x = d/(1+sqrt(9/5))
k = 8.99*(10**9)  
E = (4*(k)*(Qq2-Qq1))/d2
