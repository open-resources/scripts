## Question Section 

<b>
A microscope with an overall magnification of(overall_magnification_a) has an objective that magnifies by(objective_magnification_a).
a) What is the magnification of the eyepiece? 
ans_rule(40)

## A
has an objective that magnifies by(objective_magnification_a).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

objective_magnification_a = randrange(250,350,5)
overall_magnification_a = randrange(750,850,5)
objective_magnification_low = randrange(100,200,5)
objective_magnification_high = randrange(450,550,5)

eyepiece_magnification = overall_magnification_a/objective_magnification_a
overall_magnification_low = eyepiece_magnification*objective_magnification_low
overall_magnification_high = eyepiece_magnification*objective_magnification_high
