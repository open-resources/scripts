## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

eyepiece_focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,6,0.05))
eyepiece_magnification = randrange(4,8,2)
objective_focal_length = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.15,0.25,0.005))
objective_magnification = -randrange(375,425,25)

eyepiece_object_distance = (eyepiece_focal_length)*(1-eyepiece_magnification**-1)
objective_image_distance = (objective_focal_length)*(1-objective_magnification)
objective_object_distance = (objective_focal_length)*(1-objective_magnification**-1)
lens_spacing = eyepiece_object_distance +objective_image_distance
