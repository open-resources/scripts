## Question Section 

<b>
You switch from a(NA_oil)(NA)(60times) oil immersion objective to a(NA_air)(NA)(20times) air immersion objective. What is the acceptance angle of each? Oil has an index of refraction of(n_oil).
Oil:ans_rule(40) &#176;
Air:ans_rule(40) &#176;



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

NA_air = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.25,0.35,0.01))
NA_oil = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.35,1.45,0.01))
n_air = 1.00
n_oil = 1.51

alpha_air = (asin(NA_air/n_air))*(180/pi)
theta_air = 2*alpha_air
alpha_oil = (asin(NA_oil/n_oil))*(180/pi)
theta_oil = 2*alpha_oil
