## Question Section 

<b>
You are using a standard microscope with a(NA1)(NA)(4times) objective and switch to a(NA2)(NA)(40times) objective. What are the acceptance angles for each?
(4times) objective:  ans_rule(40)
(40times) objective:ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

NA1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.10,0.20,0.01))
NA2 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.65,0.75,0.01))
nair = 1.00

alpha1 = arcsin(NA1/nair)*(180/pi)
theta1 = 2*alpha1
alpha2 = arcsin(NA2/nair)*(180/pi)
theta2 = 2*alpha2
