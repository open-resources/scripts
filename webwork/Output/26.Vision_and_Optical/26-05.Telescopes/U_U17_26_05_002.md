<b>
Find the distance between the objective and eyepiece lenses, <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>D<span>, in the telescope above needed to produce a final image very far from the observer, where vision is most relaxed. The objective end eyepiece lenses have focal lengths of(objective_focal_length)(cm) and (eyepiece_focal_length)(cm), respectively.
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&lt; D<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

eyepiece_focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,3.0.1))
objective_focal_length = randrange(100,105,1)

lens_spacing_upper_bound = (eyepiece_focal_length+objective_focal_length)
