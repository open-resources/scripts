## Question Section 

<b>
A large reflecting telescope has an objective mirror with a(radius_of_curvatureSI)(m) radius of curvature. What angular magnification does it produce when a(eyepiece_focal_lengthSI)(m) focal length eyepiece is used?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

eyepiece_focal_lengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.8,3,0.01))
radius_of_curvatureSI = randrange(10,20,2)

objective_focal_lengthSI = 0.5*radius_of_curvatureSI

angular_magnification = -(objective_focal_lengthSI/eyepiece_focal_lengthSI)
