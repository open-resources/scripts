## Question Section 

<b>
A small telescope has a concave mirror with a(radius_of_curvatureSI)(m) radius of curvature for its objective. Its eyepiece is a(eyepiece_focal_length)(cm) focal length lens.
a) What is the telescope's angular magnification? 
ans_rule(40) 
b) What angle is subtended by a(sunspot_diameter)(km) diameter sunspot? Take the distance to the Sun to be(1.496times 10^8)(km).
ans_rule(40) &#176;

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

AU = 1.496*10**8
eyepiece_focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,4,0.1))
eyepiece_focal_lengthSI = eyepiece_focal_length*10**-2
radius_of_curvatureSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,4,0.2))
sunspot_diameter = randrange(20000,26000,2000)
sunspot_radius = 0.5*sunspot_diameter

objective_focal_lengthSI = 0.5*radius_of_curvatureSI
angular_magnification = -(objective_focal_lengthSI/eyepiece_focal_lengthSI) 

alpha_rads = atan(sunspot_radius/AU)
alpha_degrees = alpha_rads*(180/pi)
theta_degrees = 2*alpha_degrees
magnified_theta_degrees = abs(angular_magnification*theta_degrees)
