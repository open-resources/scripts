## Question Section 

<b>
A pair of(7.5times) binoculars produce an angular magnification of(angular_magnification), acting like a telescope. (Mirrors are used to make the image upright.) If the binoculars have objective lenses with a(objective_focal_length)(cm) focal length, what is the focal length of the eyepiece lenses?
ans_rule(40)(cm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

angular_magnification = sprintf("%0.2f", -randrange(8,10,0.25))
objective_focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(70,75,0.1))

eyepiece_focal_length = abs(objective_focal_length/angular_magnification)
