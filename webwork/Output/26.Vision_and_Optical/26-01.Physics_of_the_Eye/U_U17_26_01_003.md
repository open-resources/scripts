## Question Section 

<b>
The print in many books averages(object_height)(mm) in height. How high is the image of the print on the retina when the book is held(object_distance)(cm) from the eye, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm)?
ans_rule(40)(mm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
object_distance = randrange(30,40,1)
object_height = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.5,0.01))

image_height = (-object_height)*(image_distance/object_distance)
