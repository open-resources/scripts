## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the power of the eye when viewing an object(object_distanceSI)(m) away, assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm).
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
object_distanceSI = randrange(2,6,1)

focal_power = object_distanceSI**-1+image_distanceSI**-1
