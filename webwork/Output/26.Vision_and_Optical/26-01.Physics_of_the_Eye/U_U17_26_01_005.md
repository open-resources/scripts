## Question Section 

<b>
People who do very detailed work close up, such as jewelers, often can see objects clearly at much closer distance than the normal(object_distance_std)(cm).
 
a) What is the power of the eyes of a woman who can see an object clearly at a distance of only(object_distance)(cm), assuming a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
object_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(8,10,0.1))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2
object_distance_std = sprintf("%0.1f", 25)
object_distance_stdSI = object_distance_std*10**-2
object_height = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(1,3,0.1))
object_heightSI = object_height*10**-3

focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1+object_distanceSI**-1
image_heightSI_b = (-object_heightSI)*(image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
image_heightSI_c = (-object_heightSI)*(image_distanceSI/object_distance_stdSI)
