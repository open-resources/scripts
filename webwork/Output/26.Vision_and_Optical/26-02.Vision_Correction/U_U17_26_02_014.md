## Question Section 

<b>
Find the far point of a myopic man donning(focal_power)(D) glasses held(glasses_distance)(cm) from his eyes.
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power = sprintf("%0.2f", -randrange(4,7,0.25))
glasses_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.2,2,0.01))
glasses_distanceSI = glasses_distance*10**-2

image_distanceSI = focal_power**-1
far_pointSI = abs(image_distanceSI)+glasses_distanceSI
