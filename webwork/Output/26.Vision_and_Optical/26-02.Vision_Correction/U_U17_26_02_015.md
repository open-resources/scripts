## Question Section 

<b>
The contact lens prescription for a mildly farsighted person is(focal_power_lens)(D), and the person has a near point of(near_point)(cm). What is the power of the tear layer between the cornea and the lens if the correction is ideal, taking the tear layer into account?
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power_lens = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.5,0.75,0.025))
near_point  = randrange(26,30,1)
near_pointSI = near_point*10**-2
object_distance = 25
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

focal_power_total = -near_pointSI**-1+object_distanceSI**-1
focal_power_tear = focal_power_total-focal_power_lens
