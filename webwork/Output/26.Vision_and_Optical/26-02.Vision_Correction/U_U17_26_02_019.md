## Question Section 

<b>
The contact lens prescription for a nearsighted person is(focal_power_lens)(D) and the person has a far point of(far_point)(cm). What is the power of the tear layer between the cornea and the lens if the correction is ideal, taking the tear layer into account?
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

far_point = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(22.5,24.75,0.25))
far_pointSI = far_point*10**-2
focal_power_lens = sprintf("%0.2f", -randrange(4.75,5.5,0.25))

focal_power_tear = -far_pointSI**-1
focal_power_correction = focal_power_lens-focal_power_tear
