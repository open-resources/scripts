<b>
A young woman with normal distant vision has a(ratio)(%) ability to accommodate (that

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
ratio = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(10,12.5,0.1))
percent = ratio*10**-2

relaxed_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1
accommodated_focal_power = (relaxed_focal_power*(percent+1))
object_distanceSI = (image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI*accommodated_focal_power-1)
