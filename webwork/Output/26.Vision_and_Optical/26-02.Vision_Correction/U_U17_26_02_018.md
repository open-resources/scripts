## Question Section 

<b>
A college student sports(focal_power)(D) glasses(glasses_distance)(cm) from her eyes. What is her near point?
ans_rule(40)(cm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.7,0.8,0.025))
glasses_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.01))
std_near_point = 25

object_distance = std_near_point-glasses_distance

near_point = (object_distance**-1-focal_power)**-1+glasses_distance
