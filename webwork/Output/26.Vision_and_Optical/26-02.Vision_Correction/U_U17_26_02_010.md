## A
What is the relaxed power of his eyes? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

far_point = randrange(50,65,1)
far_pointSI = far_point*10**-2
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
ratio = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,10,0.1))
percent = ratio*10**-2

relaxed_focal_power = far_pointSI**-1+image_distanceSI**-1
accommodated_focal_power = relaxed_focal_power*(percent +1)
object_distanceSI = (image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI*accommodated_focal_power-1)
