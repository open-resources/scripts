## Question Section 

<b>
What was the previous far point of a patient who had laser vision correction that
reduced the power of her eye by(focal_power_decrease)(D), producing normal distant vision for her? The person's eyes have a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm).
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power_decrease = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(6,7,0.1))
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2

std_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1
initial_focal_power = std_focal_power+focal_power_decrease 
initial_far_pointSI = (image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI*initial_focal_power-1)
