## Question Section 

<b>
In a LASIK vision correction, the power of a patient's eye is increased by(focal_power_increase)(D). Assuming this produces normal close vision and a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm), what was the patient's near point before the procedure?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

focal_power_increase = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(2,3,0.1))
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", 2)
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2
std_near_point = sprintf("%0.1f", 25)
std_near_pointSI = std_near_point*10**-2

std_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1+std_near_pointSI**-1
initial_focal_power = std_focal_power-focal_power_increase
initial_near_pointSI = (image_distanceSI)/(image_distanceSI*initial_focal_power-1)
