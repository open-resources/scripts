## Question Section 

<b>
A severely myopic patient has a far point of(initial_far_point)(cm). By how many diopters should the power of his eye be reduced in laser vision correction to obtain normal distant vision? The patient has a lens-to-retina distance of(image_distance)(cm).
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

initial_far_point = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,6,0.1))
initial_far_pointSI = initial_far_point*10**-2
image_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
image_distanceSI = image_distance*10**-2

std_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1
initial_focal_power = image_distanceSI**-1+initial_far_pointSI**-1
focal_power_decrease = initial_focal_power-std_focal_power
