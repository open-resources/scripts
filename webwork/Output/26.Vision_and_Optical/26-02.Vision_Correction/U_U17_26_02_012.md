## Question Section 

<b>
A very myopic man has a far point of(far_point)(cm). What power of spectacle lens, held(glasses_distance)(cm) from his eyes, will correct his distant vision?
ans_rule(40)(D)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

far_point = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,25,0.1))
far_pointSI = far_point*10**-2
glasses_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.01))
glasses_distanceSI = glasses_distance*10**-2

image_distance = -(far_pointSI-glasses_distanceSI)
focal_power_correction = image_distance**-1
