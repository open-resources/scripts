## Question Section 

The force per meter between the two wires of a jumper cable being used to start a stalled car is(force,(Nm). What is the current in the wires, given they are separated by(distance,(cm)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(0.220,0.230,0.001)
distance = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
E = ((force*2*pi*(distance*10**-2))/(4*pi*10**-7))**(1/2)
