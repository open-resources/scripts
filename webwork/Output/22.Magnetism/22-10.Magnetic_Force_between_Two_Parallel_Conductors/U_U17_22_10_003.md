## Question Section 

A(length,(m) segment of wire supplying current to the motor of a submerged submarine carries(current,(A) and feels a(force,(N) repulsive force from a parallel wire(distance,(cm) away. What is the magnitude of the current in the other wire?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01)
current = randrange(950,1050,25)
force = randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01)
distance = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = (2*pi*(distance*10**-2)*force)/(length*(4*pi*10**-7)*current)
