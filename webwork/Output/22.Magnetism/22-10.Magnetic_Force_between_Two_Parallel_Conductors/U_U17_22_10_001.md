## Question Section 

The hot and neutral wires supplying DC power to a light-rail commuter train carry(current,(A) and are separated by(distance,(cm). What is the magnitude of the force between(length,(m) of these wires?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(790,810,1)
distance = randrange(74.5,75.5,0.1)
length = randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1)
E = (length*(4*pi*10**-7)*current**2)/(2*pi*(distance*10**-2))
