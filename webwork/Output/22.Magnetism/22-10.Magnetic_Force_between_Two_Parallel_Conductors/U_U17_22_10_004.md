## Question Section 

The wire carrying(current,(A) to the motor of a commuter train feels an attractive force of(force)(times 10^-3,(Nm) due to a parallel wire carrying(current_parallel,(A) to a headlight. How far apart are the wires?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(375,425,5)
force = randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01)
current_parallel = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current*current_parallel)/(2*pi*(force*10**-3))
