## Question Section 

What Hall voltage is produced by a(strength,(T) field applied across a(diameter,(cm) diameter aorta when blood velocity is(speed,(cms)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(59.5,60.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(0.195,0.205,0.001)
diameter = randrange(2.55,2.65,0.01)
E = (strength*(diameter*10**-2)*(speed*10**-2))*10**3
