## Question Section 

a) A patient with a pacemaker is mistakenly being scanned for an MRI image. A(length,(cm) long section of pacemaker wire moves at a speed of(speed,(cms) perpendicular to the MRI unit's magnetic field and a(voltage,(mV) Hall voltage is induced. What is the magnetic field strength?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
speed = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
voltage = randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1)
E = (voltage*10**-3)/((length*10**-2)*(speed*10**-2))
