## Question Section 

A nonmechanical water meter could utilize the Hall effect by applying a magnetic field across a metal pipe and measuring the Hall voltage produced. What is the average fluid velocity in a(diameter,(cm) diameter pipe, if a(strength,(T) field across it creates a(voltage,(mV) Hall voltage?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(59.5,60.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001)
diameter = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
E = (voltage*10**-3)/(strength*(diameter*10**-2))
