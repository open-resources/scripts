## Question Section 

Calculate the Hall voltage induced on a patient's heart while being scanned by an MRI unit. Approximate the conducting path on the heart wall by a wire(length,(cm) long that moves at(speed,(cms) perpendicular to a(strength,(T) magnetic field.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
length = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
E = (strength*(length*10**-2)*(speed*10**-2))*10**3
