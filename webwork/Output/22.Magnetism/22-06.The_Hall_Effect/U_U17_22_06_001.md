## Question Section 

A large water main is(diameter,(m) in diameter and the average water velocity is(speed,(ms). Find the Hall voltage produced if the pipe runs perpendicular to the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
diameter = randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01)
E = (strength*10**-5)*diameter*speed
