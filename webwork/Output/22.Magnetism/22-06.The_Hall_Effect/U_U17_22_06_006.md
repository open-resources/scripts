## Question Section 

A Hall probe calibrated to read(voltage)(muV) when placed in a(strength1,(T) field. What is the voltage when the probe is placed in a(strength2,(T) field?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
strength1 = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
strength2 = randrange(0.145,0.155,0.001)
E = ((strength2/strength1)*(voltage*10**-6))*10**9
