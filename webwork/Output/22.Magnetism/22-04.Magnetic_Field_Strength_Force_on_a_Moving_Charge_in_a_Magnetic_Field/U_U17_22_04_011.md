## Question Section 

A physicist performing a sensitive measurement wants to limit the magnetic force on a moving charge in her equipment to less than(force)(times 10^-12,(N). What is the greatest the charge can be if it moves at a maximum speed of(speed,(ms) in the Earth's field?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(29.5,31.5,0.1)
force = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = (force*10**-12)/(speed*(0.5*10**-4))
