## Question Section 

Aircraft sometimes acquire small static charges. Suppose a supersonic jet has a(charge) μ(C) charge and flies due west at a speed of(speed,(ms) over the Earth's south magnetic pole, where the(T)(times 10^-5,(T) magnetic field points straight up. What is the magnitude of the magnetic force on the plane?

## E
μ(C) charge and flies due west at a speed of(speed,(ms) over the Earth's south magnetic pole, where the(T)(times 10^-5,(T) magnetic field points straight up. What is the magnitude of the magnetic force on the plane?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001)
T = randrange(7.90,8.10,0.01)
speed = randrange(640,680,10)
E = (charge*10**-6)*speed*(T*10**-5)
