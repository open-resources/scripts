## Question Section 

What is the maximum force on an aluminum rod with a(charge) μ(C) charge that you pass between the poles of a(T,(T) permanent magnet at a speed of(speed,(ms)?

## E
μ(C) charge that you pass between the poles of a(T,(T) permanent magnet at a speed of(speed,(ms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = randrange(0.090,0.110,0.001)
T = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
speed = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = (charge*10**-6)*speed*T
