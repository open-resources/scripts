## Question Section 

a) A(length,(m) long section of cable carrying current to a car starter motor makes an angle of(angle^circ) with the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field. What is the current when the wire experiences a force of(force)(times 10^-3,(N)?
b) If you run the wire between the poles of a strong horseshoe magnet, subjecting(lengthb,(cm) of it to a(fieldb,(T) field, what force is exerted on this segment of wire?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(0.745,0.755,0.001)
angle = randrange(58,62,1)
strength = randrange(5.45,5.55,0.01)
force = randrange(6.95,7.05,0.01)
lengthb = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
fieldb = randrange(1.70,1.80,0.01)
E = (force*10**-3)/(length*(strength*10**-5)*sin(angle*pi/180))
F = E*(lengthb*10**-2)*fieldb
