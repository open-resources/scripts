## Question Section 

A wire carrying a(current,(A) current passes between the poles of a strong magnet that is perpendicular to its field and experiences a(force,(N) force on the(length,(cm) of wire in the field. What is the average field strength?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(29.5,30.5,0.01)
force = randrange(2.12,2.20,0.01)
length = randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01)
E = force/(current*(length*10**-2))
