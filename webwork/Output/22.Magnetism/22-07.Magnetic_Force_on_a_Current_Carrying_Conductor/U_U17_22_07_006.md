## Question Section 

What force is exerted on the water in an MHD drive utilizing a(diameter,(cm) diameter tube, if(current,(A) current is passed across the tube that is perpendicular to a(strength,(T) magnetic field? (The relatively small size of this force indicates the need for very large currents and magnetic fields to make practical MHD drives.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1)
current = randrange(90,110,5)
strength = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
E = current*(diameter*10**-2)*strength
