## Question Section 

An electron in a TV CRT moves with a speed of(speed)(times 10^7,(ms), in a direction perpendicular to the Earth's field, which has a strength of(strength)(times 10^-5,(T).
a) What strength electric field must be applied perpendicular to the Earth's field to make the electron moves in a straight line?
b) If this is done between plates separated by(D,(cm), what is the voltage applied? (Note that TVs are usually surrounded by a ferromagnetic material to shield against external magnetic fields and avoid the need for such a correction.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
D = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = ((speed*10**7)*(strength*10**-5))*10**-3
F = ((speed*10**7)*(strength*10**-5))*(D*10**-2)
