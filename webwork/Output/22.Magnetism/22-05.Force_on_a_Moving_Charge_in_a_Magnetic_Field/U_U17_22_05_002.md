## Question Section 

A proton moves at(speed)(times 10^7,(ms) perpendicular to a magnetic field. The field causes the proton to travel in a circular path of radius(radius,(m). What is the field strength?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
radius = randrange(0.795,0.805,0.001)
E = ((1.67*10**-27)*(speed*10**7))/((1.6*10**-19)*radius)
