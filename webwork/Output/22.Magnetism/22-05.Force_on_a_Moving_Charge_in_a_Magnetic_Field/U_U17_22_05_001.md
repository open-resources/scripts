## Question Section 

A cosmic ray electron moves at(speed)(times 10^6,(ms) perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field at an altitude where field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T). What is the radius of the circular path the electron follows?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
strength = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = ((9.11*10**-31)*(speed*10**6))/((1.6*10**-19)*(strength*10**-5))
