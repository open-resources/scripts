## Question Section 

Viewers of Star Trek hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship Enterprise. One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store antimatter charged particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, and then extract them as needed. Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy. What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons, moving at(speed)(times 10^7,(ms) in a circular path(radius,(m) in radius? Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but the opposite (negative) charge.

## E
charge.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
radius = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
E = ((1.67*10**-27)*(speed*10**7))/((1.6*10**-19)*radius)
