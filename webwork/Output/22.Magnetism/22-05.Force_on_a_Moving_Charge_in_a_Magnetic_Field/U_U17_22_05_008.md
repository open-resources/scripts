## Question Section 

a) At what speed will a proton move in a circular path of(D,(m) where the field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T)? 
b) What would the radius of the path be if the proton had a speed of(speed)(times 10^6,(ms)?

## A
At what speed will a proton move in a circular path of(D,(m) where the field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T)? 
### Answer Section
## B
What would the radius of the path be if the proton had a speed of(speed)(times 10^6,(ms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(7.1,7.9,0.1)
strength = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
D = randrange(4.20,4.29,0.01)
E = ((1.6*10**-19)*(strength*10**-5)*D)/(1.67*10**-27)
F = ((1.67*10**-27)*(speed*10**6))/((1.6*10**-19)*(strength*10**-5))
