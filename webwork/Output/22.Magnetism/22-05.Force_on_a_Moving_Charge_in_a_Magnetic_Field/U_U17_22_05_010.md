## Question Section 

Triply charged uranium-235 and uranium-238 ions are being separated in a mass spectrometer. (The much rarer uranium-235 is used as reactor fuel.) The masses of the ions are(3.90times 10^-25,(kg) and(3.95times 10^-25,(kg), respectively, and they travel at(3.00times 10^5,(ms) in a(0.250,(T) field.
What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle?

## G
and(3.95times 10^-25,(kg), respectively, and they travel at(3.00times 10^5,(ms) in a(0.250,(T) field.
