## Question Section 

A mass spectrometer is being used to separate common oxygen-16 from the much rarer oxygen-18, taken from a sample of old glacial ice. (The relative abundance of these oxygen isotopes is related to climatic temperature at the time the ice was deposited.) The ratio of the masses of these two ions is 16 to 18, the mass of oxygen-16 is(2.66times 10^-26,(kg), and they are singly charged and travel at(5.00times 10^6,(ms) in a(1.20,(T) magnetic field.
What is the separation between their paths when they hit a target after traversing a semicircle?
