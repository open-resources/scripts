## Question Section 

A velocity selector in a mass spectrometer uses a(T,(T) magnetic field.
a) What electric field strength is needed to select a speed of(speed)(times 10^6,(ms)?
b) What is the voltage between the plates if they are separated by(D,(cm)?

## A
What electric field strength is needed to select a speed of(speed)(times 10^6,(ms)?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the voltage between the plates if they are separated by(D,(cm)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
T = randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001)
speed = randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01)
D = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = (speed*10**6)*T
F = (E*(D*10**-2))*10**-3
