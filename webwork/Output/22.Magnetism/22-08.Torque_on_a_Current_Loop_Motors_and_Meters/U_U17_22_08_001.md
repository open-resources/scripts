## Question Section 

a) By how many percent is the torque of a motor decreased if its permanent magnets lose(percent(%) of their strength?
b) How many percent would the current need to be increased to return the torque to original values?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(4.9,5.1,0.1)
E = percent
F = ((100/(100-percent))-1)*10**2
