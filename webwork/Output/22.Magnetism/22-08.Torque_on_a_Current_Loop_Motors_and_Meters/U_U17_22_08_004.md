## Question Section 

Calculate the magnetic field strength needed on a(turns) turn square loop(length,(cm) on a side to create a maximum torque of(torque,(Nm) if the loop is carrying(current,(A).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
torque = randrange(275,325,5)
turns = randrange(175,225,5)
length = randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1)
current = randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1)
E = torque/(turns*((length*10**-2)**2)*current)
