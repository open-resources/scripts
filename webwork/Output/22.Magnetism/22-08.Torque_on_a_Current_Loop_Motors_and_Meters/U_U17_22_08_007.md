## Question Section 

A proton has a magnetic field due to its spin on its axis. The field is similar to that created by a circular current loop(radius)(times 10^-15,(m) in radius with a current of(current)(times 10^4,(A). Find the maximum torque on a proton in a(strength,(T) field.
(Nm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
radius = randrange(0.645,0.655,0.001)
current = randrange(1.00,1.10,0.01)
strength = randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01)
E = ((current*10**4)*pi*((radius*10**-15)**2)*strength)*10**26
