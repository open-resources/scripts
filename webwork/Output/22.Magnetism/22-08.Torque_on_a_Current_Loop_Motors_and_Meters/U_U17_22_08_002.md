## Question Section 

a) What is the maximum torque on a(turns) turn square loop of wire(length,(cm) on a side that carries a(current,(A) current in a(strength,(T) field?
b) What is the torque when(theta) is(angle^circ)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(140,160,5)
length = randrange(17.5,18.5,0.1)
current = randrange(49.5,51.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(1.55,1.65,0.01)
angle = randrange(10.5,11.3,0.1)
E = turns*current*((length*10**-2)**2)*strength
F = turns*current*((length*10**-2)**2)*strength*sin(angle*pi/180)
