## Question Section 

One long straight wire is to be held directly above another by repulsion between their currents. The lower wire carries(current) A and the wire(distance,(cm) above it is 10-gauge ((diameter,(mm) diameter) copper wire.
a) What current must flow in the upper wire, neglecting the Earth's field?
b) What is the smallest current if the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field is parallel to the ground and is not neglected?

## A
What current must flow in the upper wire, neglecting the Earth's field?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the smallest current if the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field is parallel to the ground and is not neglected?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(95,105,1)
distance = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
diameter = randrange(2.583,2.592,0.001)
strength = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
radius = (diameter*10**-3)/2
E = (2*(pi**2)*(distance*10**-2)*(8.8*10**3)*(radius**2)*9.8)/((4*pi*10**-7)*current)
F = (pi*(8.8*10**3)*(radius**2)*9.8)/((((4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*pi*(distance*10**-2)))+(strength*10**-5))
