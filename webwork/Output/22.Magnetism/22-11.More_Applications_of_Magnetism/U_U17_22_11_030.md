## Question Section 

An inventor wants to generate(volt,(V) power by moving a(length,(m) long wire perpendicular to the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field.
Find the speed with which the wire must move.
(texrms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
volt = randrange(115,125,1)
length = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = volt/((strength*10**-5)*length)
