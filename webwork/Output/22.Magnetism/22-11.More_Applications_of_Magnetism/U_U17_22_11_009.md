## Question Section 

How far from the starter cable of a car, carrying(current,(A), must you be to experience a field less than the Earth's ((5.00)(times 10^-5)(T))? Assume a long straight wire carries the current. (In practice, the body of your car shields the dashboard compass.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(140,160,1)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*pi*(5*10**-5))
