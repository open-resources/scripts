## Question Section 

A charged particle having mass(mass)(times 10^-27,(kg) (that of a helium atom) moving at(speed)(times 10^5,(ms) perpendicular to a(strength,(T) magnetic field travels in a circular path of radius(radius,(mm).
What is the charge of the particle?
(C)

## G
(that of a helium atom) moving at(speed)(times 10^5,(ms) perpendicular to a(strength,(T) magnetic field travels in a circular path of radius(radius,(mm).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(6.62,6.66,0.01)
speed = randrange(8.65,8.75,0.01)
strength = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
radius = randrange(15.5,16.5,0.1)
E = (((mass*10**-27)*(speed*10**5))/((radius*10**-3)*strength))*10**19
