## A
Find the radius of curvature of the path of a(charge,(MeV) proton moving perpendicularly to the(strength,(T) field of a cyclotron.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
joules = ((charge*10**6)*1.60*10**-19)*10**12
speed = ((2*(joules*10**-12))/(1.67*10**-27))**(1/2)
E = ((1.67*10**-27)*speed)/((1.6*10**-19)*strength)
