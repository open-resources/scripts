## Question Section 

Calculate the size of the magnetic field(distance,(m) below a high voltage power line. The line carries(watt,(MW) at a voltage of(voltage,(V).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1)
watt = randrange(445,455,1)
voltage = randrange(275000,325000,5000)
current = (watt*10**6)/(voltage)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*pi*(distance))
