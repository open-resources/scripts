## Question Section 

Find the charge on a baseball, thrown at(speed,(ms) perpendicular to the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field, that experiences a(force,(N) magnetic force.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(34.5,35.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
force = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = force/(speed*(strength*10**-5))
