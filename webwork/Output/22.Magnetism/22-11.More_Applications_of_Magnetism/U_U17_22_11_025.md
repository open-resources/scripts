## Question Section 

A(mass,(kg) baseball, pitched at(speed,(ms) horizontally and perpendicular to the Earth's horizontal(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field, has a(charge,(nC) charge on it. What distance is it deflected from its path by the magnetic force, after traveling(distance,(m) horizontally?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.135,0.145,0.001)
speed = randrange(39.5,40.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
charge = randrange(95,105,1)
distance = randrange(29.5,30.5,0.1)
radius = (mass*speed)/((charge*10**-9)*(strength*10**-5))
theta = (distance/radius)*360
theta_radians = theta*pi/180
E = distance*sin(theta_radians/2)
