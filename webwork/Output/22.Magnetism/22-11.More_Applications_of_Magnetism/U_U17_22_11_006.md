## Question Section 

Nonnuclear submarines use batteries for power when submerged.
Find the magnetic field(distance,(cm) from a straight wire carrying(current,(A) from the batteries to the drive mechanism of a submarine.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1)
current = randrange(1100,1300,10)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*pi*(distance*10**-2))
