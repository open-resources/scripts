## Question Section 

a) Calculate the maximum torque on a(turns) turn,(radius,(cm) radius circular current loop carrying(current) μ(A) in a(strength,(T) field.
b) If this coil is to be used in a galvanometer that reads(scale) μ(A) full scale, what force constant spring must be used, if it is attached(distance,(cm) from the axis of rotation and is stretched by the(60^circ) arc moved?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(45,55,1)
radius = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
current = randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001)
scale = current
distance = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
E = turns*(current*10**-6)*pi*((radius*10**-2)**2)*strength
F = (3*E)/(((distance*10**-2)**2)*pi)
