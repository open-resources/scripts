## Question Section 

a) Calculate the force per meter if the wire carries(current,(A) and the field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T).
b) What diameter copper wire would have its weight supported by this force?
c) Calculate the resistance per meter and the voltage per meter needed.
Resistance per meter:
(m)
Voltage per meter:

## A
Calculate the force per meter if the wire carries(current,(A) and the field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T).
### Answer Section
## B
What diameter copper wire would have its weight supported by this force?
### Answer Section
## C
Calculate the resistance per meter and the voltage per meter needed.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
E = current*(strength*10**-5)
radius = ((E)/((8.8*10**3)*pi*9.8))**(1/2)
F = 2*radius
G = (1.72*10**-8)/(pi*radius**2)
H = current*G
