## Question Section 

a) Estimate the field the loop creates by calculating the field at the center of a circular loop(diameter)(cm) in diameter carrying(current)(A).
b) What is the smallest field strength this loop can be used to measure, if its field must alter the measured field by less than(percent)(%)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1)
current = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
percent = randrange(0.0095,0.0105,0.0001)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*((diameter/2)*10**-2))
F = E/(percent*10**-2)
