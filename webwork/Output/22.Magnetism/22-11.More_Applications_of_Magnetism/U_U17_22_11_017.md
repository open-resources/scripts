## A
What voltage will accelerate electrons to a speed of(speed)(times 10^-7,(ms)?
### Answer Section
## B
Find the radius of curvature of the path of a proton accelerated through this potential in a(strength,(T) field.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001)
E = (((9.11*10**-31)*(speed*10**-7)**2)/(2*(1.6*10**-19)))*10**24
speed_proton = (((2*(1.6*10**-19)*(E*10**-24))/(1.67*10**-27))**(1/2))*10**8
F = (((1.67*10**-27)*(speed_proton*10**-8))/((1.6*10**-19)*strength))*10**16
