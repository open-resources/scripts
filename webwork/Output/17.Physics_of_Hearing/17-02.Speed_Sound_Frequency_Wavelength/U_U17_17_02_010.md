## Question Section 

A physicist at a fireworks display times the lag between seeing an explosion and hearing its sound, and finds it to be(t,(s). 
a) How far away is the explosion if air temperature is(TC ^circ(C) and if you neglect the time taken for light to reach the physicist? 
b) Calculate the distance to the explosion taking the speed of light into account. Note that this distance is negligibly greater.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

t = randrange(.4,.420,0.001)
TC = 24
T = TC+273.15
v = 331*(sqrt(T/273.15))
da = v*t
c = 2.998*(10**8)
t1 = da/c
db = v*(t+t1)
