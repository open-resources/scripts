## Question Section 

If a submarine's sonar can measure echo times with a precision of(t,(s), what
is the smallest difference in distances it can detect? (Assume that the submarine is in
the ocean, not in fresh water.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

t = randrange(.01,.020,0.001)
vf = 1540
d= vf*t/2
