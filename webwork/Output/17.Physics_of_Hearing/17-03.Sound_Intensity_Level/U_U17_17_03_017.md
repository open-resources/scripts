## Question Section 

Ear trumpets were never very common, but they did aid people with hearing losses by gathering sound over a large area and concentrating it on the smaller area of the eardrum. What decibel increase does an ear trumpet produce if its sound gathering area is(Atcm^2) and the area of the eardrum is(Aecm^2), but the trumpet only has an efficiency of(efficiency,(% ) in transmitting the sound to the eardrum?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

At = randrange(850,965,1)
Ae = randrange(0.5,0.6,0.001)
efficiency = randrange(4,7,1)
percent = efficiency/100
I = (percent*At)/Ae
B = 10*log10(I)
