## Question Section 

a) What is the intensity of a sound that has a level(dBa,(dB) lower than a(4.00times 10^-9Wm^2) sound? 
b) What is the intensity of a sound that is(dBb,(dB) higher than a(4.00times 10^-9Wm^2) sound?

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

dBa = 7
dBb = 3
Io = 4*(10**-9)
Ia = Io/5
Ib = Io*2
