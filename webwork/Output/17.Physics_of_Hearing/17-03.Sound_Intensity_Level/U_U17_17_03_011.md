## Question Section 

People with good hearing can perceive sounds as low in level as(dB,(dB) at a
frequency of(3000,(Hz). What is the intensity of this sound in watts per meter
squared?
(Wm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dB = randrange(-9,-7,1)
B = 10**(dB/10)
Io = 1*(10**-12)
I = Io*B*(10**13)
