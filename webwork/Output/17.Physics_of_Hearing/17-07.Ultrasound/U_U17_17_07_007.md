## Question Section 

a) Find the size of the smallest detail observable in human tissue with(fMHz,(MHz)
ultrasound. 
b) Is its effective penetration depth great enough to examine the entire eye (about(3.00)(cm) is needed)? 
c) What is the wavelength of such ultrasound in(0 ^circ(C) air?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

fMHz = randrange(20,25,1)
f = fMHz*(10**6)
vw = 1540
gamma = vw/f
x = 500*gamma*100
gammac = 331/fMHz/1000000
