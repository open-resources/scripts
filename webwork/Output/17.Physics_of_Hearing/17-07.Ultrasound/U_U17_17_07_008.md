## Question Section 

a) Echo times are measured by diagnostic ultrasound scanners to determine
distances to reflecting surfaces in a patient. What is the difference in echo times for
tissues that are(d1cm) and(d2cm)(cm) beneath the surface? (This difference is the
minimum resolving time for the scanner to see details as small as(0.100,(cm), or(1.00,(mm). Discrimination of smaller time differences is needed to see smaller details.) 
b) Discuss whether the period(T) of this ultrasound must be smaller than the minimum
time resolution. If so, what is the minimum frequency of the ultrasound and is that out
of the normal range for diagnostic ultrasound?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

d2cm = randrange(3.6,3.7,0.01)
d2 = d2cm/100
d1cm = randrange(3.4,3.5,0.01)
d1 = d1cm/100
vw = 1540
t = (2*(d2-d1))/vw
f = 1/t
