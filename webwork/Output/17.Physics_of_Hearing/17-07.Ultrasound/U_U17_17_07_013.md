## Question Section 

Ultrasound reflected from an oncoming bloodstream that is moving at(vbcm,(cms) is
mixed with the original frequency of(fMHz,(MHz) to produce beats. What is the beat
frequency? (Assume that the frequency of(fMHz,(MHz) is accurate to seven significant
figures.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

fMHz = randrange(2.10,2.75,0.01)
fs = fMHz*(10**6)
vbcm = randrange(30,40,1)
vb = vbcm/100
vw = 1540
fobs = fs*((vw+vb)/(vw-vb))
fb = fobs-fs
