## Question Section 

A diagnostic ultrasound echo is reflected from moving blood and returns with a
frequency(fs,(Hz) higher than its original(fMHz,(MHz). What is the velocity of the blood?
(Assume that the frequency of(fMHz,(MHz) is accurate to seven significant figures and
(fs,(Hz) is accurate to three significant figures.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

fMHz = randrange(100,125,1)
fobs = fMHz*(10**6)
fs = randrange(500,560,1)
vw = 1540
vb = vw*(fs/(fobs+fobs+fs))
