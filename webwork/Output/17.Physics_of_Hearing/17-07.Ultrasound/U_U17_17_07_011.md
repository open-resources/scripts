## Question Section 

A dolphin is able to tell in the dark that the ultrasound echoes received from two
sharks come from two different objects only if the sharks are separated by(d,(m),
one being that much farther away than the other. 
a) If the ultrasound has a frequency of(fkHz,(kHz), show this ability is not limited by its wavelength.
b) If this ability is due to the dolphin's ability to detect the arrival times of echoes, what is the minimum time difference the dolphin can perceive?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

fkHz = randrange(100,125,1)
f = fkHz*(10**3)
vw = 1540
gamma = vw/f
d = randrange(3.3,3.7,0.01)
t = (2*d)/vw
