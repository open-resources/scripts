## Question Section 

The time delay between transmission and the arrival of the reflected wave of a signal
using ultrasound traveling through a piece of fat tissue was(tms,(ms). At what depth
did this reflection occur?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

tms = randrange(.1,.3,0.01)
t = tms*(10**-3)
v = 1540
x = (v*t)/2
