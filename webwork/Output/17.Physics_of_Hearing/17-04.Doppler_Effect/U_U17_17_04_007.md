## Question Section 

Two eagles fly directly toward one another, the first at(vo1,(ms) and the second at(vo2,(ms). Both screech, the first one emitting a frequency of(fs1,(Hz) and the second one emitting a frequency of(fs2,(Hz). What frequency does the first eagle receive if the speed of sound is(vw,(ms)?
b) What frequency does the second eagle?

What frequency does the second eagle?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vw = randrange(330,334,1)
vo1 = randrange(10,15,1)
vo2 = randrange(20,25,1)
fs1 = randrange(3150,3250,1)
fs2 = randrange(3750,3850,1)
fobs1 = fs2*((vw+vo1)/vw)*(vw/(vw-vo2))
fobs2 = fs1*((vw+vo2)/vw)*(vw/(vw-vo1))
