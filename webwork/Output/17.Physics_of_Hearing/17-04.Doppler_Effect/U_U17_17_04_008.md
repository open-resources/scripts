## Question Section 

What is the minimum speed at which a source must travel toward you for you to be
able to hear that its frequency is Doppler shifted? That is, what speed produces a shift
of(0.300,(%) on a day when the speed of sound is(vw,(ms)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vw = randrange(330,336,1)
fobss = 1.003
vs = vw*((fobss-1)/fobss)
