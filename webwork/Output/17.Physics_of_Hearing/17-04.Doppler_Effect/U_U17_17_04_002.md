## Question Section 

a) At an air show a jet flies directly toward the stands at a speed of(vskm,(kmh),
emitting a frequency of(fs,(Hz), on a day when the speed of sound is(vw,(ms). What frequency is received by the observers? 
b) What frequency do they receive as the plane flies directly away from them?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vskm = randrange(1100,1260,1)
vs = vskm*(1000/3600)
vw = randrange(341,343,1)
fs = randrange(3500,3820,1)
fobs = fs*(vw/(vw-vs))
fsb = fs*(vw/(vw+vs))
