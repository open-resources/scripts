## Question Section 

What is the first overtone of a bassoon that has a fundamental frequency of(f1,(Hz)? It is open at both ends. (The overtones of a real bassoon are more complex than this example, because its double reed makes it act more like a tube closed at one end.)
What is its second overtone?
What is its third overtone?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f1 = randrange(92,99,1)
f2 = 2*f1
f3 = 3*f1
f4 = 4*f1
