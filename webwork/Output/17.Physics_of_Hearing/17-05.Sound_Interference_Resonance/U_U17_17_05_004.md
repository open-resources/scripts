## Question Section 

A piano tuner hears a beat every(Tb,(s) when listening to a(f,(Hz) tuning fork and a single piano string. What is the first possible frequency of the string?
What is the second possible frequency of the string?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Tb = randrange(2,3,1)
f = randrange(264,266,1)
fb1 = abs((1/Tb)+f)
fb2 = abs((1/Tb)-f)
