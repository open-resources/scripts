## Question Section 

If a wind instrument, such as a tuba, has a fundamental frequency of(f1,(Hz), what
is its first overtone? It is closed at one end. (The overtones of a real tuba are
more complex than this example, because it is a tapered tube.)
What is its second overtone?
What is its third overtone?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f1 = randrange(32,39,1)
f3 = 3*f1
f5 = 5*f1
f7 = 7*f1
