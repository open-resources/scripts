## Question Section 

a) Students in a physics lab are asked to find the length of an air column in a tube
closed at one end that has a fundamental frequency of(f1,(Hz). They hold the tube
vertically and fill it with water to the top, then lower the water while a(f1,(Hz) tuning
fork is rung and listen for the first resonance. What is the air temperature if the
resonance occurs for a length of(L,(m)? 
b) At what length will they observe the second resonance (first overtone)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

L = randrange(0.335,0.359,0.01)
f1 = randrange(255,257,1)
vw = 331
T1 = 273.15
T = ((16*(L**2)*(f1**2)*T1)/(vw**2))-273.15
Lb = 3*L
