## Question Section 

Calculate the first overtone in an ear canal, which resonates like a(Lcm,(cm) long tube closed at one end, by taking air temperature to be(TC ^circ(C). Is the ear particularly sensitive to such a frequency? (The resonances of the ear canal are complicated by its nonuniform shape, which we shall ignore.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Lcm = randrange(2.35,2.59,0.01)
L = Lcm/100
TC = randrange(35,39,1)
T = TC+273.15
vw = 331*sqrt(T/273.15)
f3 = 3*(vw/(4*L))
