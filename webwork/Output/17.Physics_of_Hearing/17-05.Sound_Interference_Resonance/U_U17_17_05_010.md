## Question Section 

What is the length of a tube that has a fundamental frequency of(f1,(Hz) and a first
overtone of(f2,(Hz) if the speed of sound is(vw,(ms)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f1 = randrange(170,189,1)
f2 = randrange(350,369,1)
f = f2-f1
vw = randrange(342,344,1)
L = vw/(2*f)
