## Question Section 

The factor of(10^-12) in the range of intensities to which the ear can respond, from
threshold to that causing damage after brief exposure, is truly remarkable. If you
could measure distances over the same range with a single instrument and the
smallest distance you could measure was(dmm,(mm), what would the largest be?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dmm = randrange(1,9,1)
d = dmm*(10**-3)
dlarge = d*(1*(10**12))/1000
