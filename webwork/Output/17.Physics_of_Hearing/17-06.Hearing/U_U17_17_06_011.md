## Question Section 

Suppose a person has a(dB,(dB) hearing loss at all frequencies. By how many factors of(10) will low-intensity sounds need to be amplified to seem normal to this person? Note that smaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further hearing damage.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dB = randrange(50,80,10)
factor = dB/10
