## Question Section 

The frequencies to which the ear responds vary by a factor of(10^3). Suppose the
speedometer on your car measured speeds differing by the same factor of(10^3), and
the greatest speed it reads is(v,(mih). What would be the slowest nonzero speed it
could read?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v = randrange(90,99,1)
factor = 1*(10**3)
velocity = v/factor
