## Question Section 

If a woman needs an amplification of(5.0times 10^12) times the threshold intensity to enable her to hear at all frequencies, what is her overall hearing loss in(dB)? Note that
smaller amplification is appropriate for more intense sounds to avoid further damage
to her hearing from levels above(90,(dB).
