## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Suppose you have a(resgalvSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> galvanometer with a(current)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A<span> sensitivity.
What resistance would you put in series with it to allow it to be used as a voltmeter that has a full-scale deflection for(emf)(mV)?
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resgalvSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(38.5,41.5,0.1))
current = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24,26,0.1))
currentSI = current*10**-6
emf = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001))
emfSI = emf*10**-3

resistorSI = (emfSI/currentSI)-resgalvSI
