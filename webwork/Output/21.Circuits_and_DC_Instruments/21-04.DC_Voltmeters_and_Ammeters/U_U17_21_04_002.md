## Question Section 

<b>
What is the sensitivity of the galvanometer (that is, what current gives a full-scale deflection) inside a voltmeter that has a(resistance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> resistance on its(emfSI)-(V) scale?
ans_rule(40)(mA)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = randrange(95,105,1)
resistance = randrange(24,36,1)
resistanceSI = resistance*10**3

currentSI = (emfSI)/(resistanceSI)
currentmA = currentSI*10**3
