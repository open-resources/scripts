## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resgalvSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(38.5,41.5,0.1))
currentsens = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(24,26,0.1))
currentsensSI = currentsens*10**-6
currentscale = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
currentscaleSI = currentscale*10**-6

resistanceSI = resgalvSI*((currentsensSI)/((currentscaleSI)-(currentsensSI)))
