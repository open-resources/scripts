## Question Section 

<b>
What is the sensitivity of the galvanometer (that is, what current gives a full-scale deflection) inside a voltmeter that has a(resistance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;<span> resistance on its(emfSI)-(V) scale?
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;A<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = randrange(28,32,1)
resistance = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.90,1.1,0.01))
resistanceSI = resistance*10**6

currentSI = (emfSI)/(resistanceSI)
currentmuA = currentSI*10**6
