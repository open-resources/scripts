![Voltmeter]("NU_U17_21_04_009.png")

<b>
Suppose you measure the terminal voltage of a(emfSI)-(V) alkaline cell having an internal resistance of(intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> by placing a(resvolt)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> voltmeter across its terminals as in the figure above.
a) What current flows?
ans_rule(40)(A)

## A
What current flows?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(1.575,1.595,0.001))
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.095,0.105,0.005))
resvolt = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
resvoltSI = resvolt*10**3

currentSI = (emfSI)/(intresSI+resvoltSI)
terminalvoltageSI = emfSI-(currentSI*intresSI)
ratio = ((terminalvoltageSI)/(emfSI))
