## A
What is its terminal voltage?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.56,1.6,0.01))
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.190,0.210,0.001))
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8.55,8.7,0.01))

terminalvoltageSI = emfSI-(currentSI*intresSI)
resloadSI = (emfSI/currentSI)-intresSI
