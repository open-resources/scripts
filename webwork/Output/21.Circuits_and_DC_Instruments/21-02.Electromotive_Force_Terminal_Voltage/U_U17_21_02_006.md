## A
Find the terminal voltage of a(emfSI)-(V) motorcycle battery having a(intresSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> internal resistance, if it is being charged by a current of(currentSI)(A).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(11.5,12.5,0.5))
intresSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.575,0.75,0.025))
currentSI = randrange(9,12,1)

terminalvoltageSI = emfSI+(current*ineres)
voltagechargerSI = terminalvoltageSI
