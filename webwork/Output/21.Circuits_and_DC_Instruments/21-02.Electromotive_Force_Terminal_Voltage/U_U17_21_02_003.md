## Question Section 

<b>
What is the output voltage of a(emfSI)-(V) lithium cell in a digital wristwatch that draws(current)(mA), if the cell's internal resistance is(intresSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(2.75,3.25,0.25))
current = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.2,0.4,0.025))
currentSI = current*10**-3
intresSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.75,2.25,0.25))

terminalvoltageSI = emfSI-(currentSI*intresSI)
