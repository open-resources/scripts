## Question Section 

<b>
The label on a portable radio recommends the use of rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells (NiCads), although they have a(emfnickelSI)-(V) emf while alkaline cells have a(emfalkSI)-(V) emf. The radio has a(resradioSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistance. Calculate the power delivered to the radio:
a) When using NiCad cells each having an internal resistance of(resnickelSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>.
b) When using alkaline cells each having an internal resistance of(resalkSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>.

## A
When using NiCad cells each having an internal resistance of(resnickelSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>.
### Answer Section
## B
When using alkaline cells each having an internal resistance of(resalkSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfnickelSI = randrange(1.23,1.27,0.02)
emfalkSI = randrange(1.55,1.61,0.03)
resradioSI = randrange(3.1,3.6,0.1)
resnickelSI = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.0375,0.0425,0.0025))
resalkSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.175,0.225,0.025))

currentnickelSI = emfnickelSI/(resradioSI+resnickelSI)
powernickelSI = (currentnickelSI**2)*resradioSI

currentalkSI = emfalkSI/(resradioSI+resalkSI)
poweralkSI = (currentalkSI**2)*resradioSI
