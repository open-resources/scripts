<b>
A(resistorSI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor, an uncharged(capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F<span> capacitor, and a(emfSI)-(V) emf are connected in series.
a) What is the initial current? 
ans_rule(40)(mA)

## A
What is the initial current? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
resistorSI = randrange(490,530,5)
capacitance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6
emfSI = randrange(6.14,6.18,0.01)

current1SI = (emfSI/resistorSI)
current1mA = current1SI*10**3

voltage2SI = (emfSI)*(1-exp(1))
deltavoltageSI = emfSI-voltage2SI

current2SI = (deltavoltageSI/resistorSI)
current2mA = current2SI*10**3

t = (resistorSI)*(capacitanceSI)
