## Question Section 

<b>
A heart pacemaker fires(tmin) times a minute, each time a(capacitance)-(nF) capacitor is charged (by a battery in series with a resistor) to(0.632)(%) of its full voltage. What is the value of the resistance?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
tmin = randrange(70,74,1)
t = 60/tmin
capacitance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-9

resistanceSI = t/(capacitanceSI)
