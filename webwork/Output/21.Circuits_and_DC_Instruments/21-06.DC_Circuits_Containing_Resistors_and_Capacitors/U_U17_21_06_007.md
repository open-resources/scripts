## Question Section 

<b>
An ECG monitor must have an RC time constant less than(ttimes 10^2) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;s<span> to be able to measure variations in voltage over small time intervals.
If the resistance of the circuit (due mostly to that of the patient's chest) is(resistance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span>, what is the maximum capacitance of the circuit?
ans_rule(40)(F)

## E
<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span>, what is the maximum capacitance of the circuit?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
tSI = t*10**-4
resistance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
resistanceSI = resistance*10**3

capacitanceSI = tSI/resistanceSI
