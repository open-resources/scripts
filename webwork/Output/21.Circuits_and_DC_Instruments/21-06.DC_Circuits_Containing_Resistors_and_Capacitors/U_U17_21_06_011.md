## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> If you wish to take a picture of a bullet traveling at(velocitySI)(ms), then a very brief flash of light produced by an RC discharge through a flash tube can limit blurring. Assuming(distance)(mm) of motion during one RC constant is acceptable, and given that the flash is driven by a(capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F<span> capacitor, what is the resistance in the flash tube? 
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
velocitySI = randrange(495,505,1)
distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
distanceSI = distance*10**-3
capacitance = randrange(595,605,1)
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6

resistanceSI = (distanceSI)/(velocitySI*capacitanceSI)
