## Question Section 

<b>
The timing device in an automobile's intermittent wiper system is based on an RC time constant and utilizes a(capacitance)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&mu;F<span> capacitor and a variable resistor. Over what range must its resistance be made to vary to achieve time constants from(t1)(s) to(t2)(s)?
Low-End:
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>
High-End:
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6
t1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
t2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14.5,15.5,0.1))

resistancelowSI = t1/(capacitanceSI)
resistancehighSI = t2/(capacitanceSI)
resistancehighMohm = resistancehighSI*10**-6
