## Question Section 

<b>
What is the emf<sub>x<sub> of a cell being measured in a potentiometer, if the standard cell's emf is(emf)(V) and the potentiometer balances for(R)(_x) =(Rx) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> and(R)(_s) =(Rs) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emf = randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1)
Rx = randrange(4.995,5.005,0.001)
Rs = randrange(2.495,2.505,0.001)
emfx = emf*((Rx)/(Rs))
