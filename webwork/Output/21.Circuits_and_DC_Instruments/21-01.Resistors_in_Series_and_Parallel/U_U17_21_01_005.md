## Question Section 

<b>
Your car's(powerheadlightSI)-(W) headlight and(powerstarter)-(kW) starter are ordinarily connected in parallel in a(voltageSI)-(V) system. What power would one headlight and the starter consume if connected in series to a(voltageSI)-(V) battery? (Neglect any other resistance in the circuit and any change in resistance in the two devices.)
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
powerheadlightSI = randrange(29,31,1)
powerstarter = randrange(2.3,2.5,0.1)
powerstarterSI = powerstarter*1000
voltageSI = randrange(11,13,1)

resheadlightSI = (voltageSI**2)/powerheadlightSI
resstarterSI = (voltageSI**2)/powerstarterSI
seriesresistanceSI = resheadlightSI+resstarterSI

seriespowerSI = (voltageSI**2)/seriesresistanceSI
