## Question Section 

<b>
Given a(voltageSI)-(V) battery and(res1SI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> and(res2SI)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistors, find the current and power for each when connected in series.
Current:
ans_rule(40)(A)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltageSI = randrange(46,54,2)
res1SI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,30,0.1))
res2SI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,100,0.1))

seriesresistanceSI = res1SI+res2SI
currentSI = voltageSI/(seriesresistanceSI)
powerres1SI = (currentSI**2)*res1SI
powerres2SI = (currentSI**2)*res2SI
