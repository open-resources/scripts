![Power line]("NU_U17_21_01_010.png")

<b>
A(voltage)-(kV) power transmission line carrying(currenttimes 10^2)(A) is hung from grounded metal towers by ceramic insulators, each having a(restimes 10^9)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistance.
a) What is the resistance to ground of(number) of these insulators?

## A
What is the resistance to ground of(number) of these insulators?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = 240
voltageSI = voltage*10**3
current = sprintf("%0.2f",5)
currentSI = current*10**2
res = sprintf("%0.2f",1)
resSI = res*10**9
number = randrange(80,100,10)

parallelresistanceSI = (resSI)/number
respowerSI = ((voltageSI)**2)/parallelresistanceSI
linepowerSI = (currentSI)*(voltageSI)
ratio = respowerSI/linepowerSI
