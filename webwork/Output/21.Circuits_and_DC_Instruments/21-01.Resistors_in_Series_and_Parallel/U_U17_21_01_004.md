## Question Section 

<b>
An(powertoasterSI)-(W) toaster, a(powerpanSI)-(W) electric frying pan, and a(powerlampSI)-(W) lamp are plugged into the same outlet in a(15)-(A),(voltageSI)-(V)circuit. (The three devices are in parallel when plugged into the same socket.). What current is drawn by each device?
Toaster
Frying Pan
Lamp



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
powertoasterSI = randrange(1700,1900,100)
powerpanSI = randrange(1300,1500,100)
powerlampSI = randrange(50,100,25)
voltageSI = randrange(110,130,10)

currenttoasterSI = powertoasterSI/voltageSI
currentpanSI = powerpanSI/voltageSI
currentlampSI = powerlampSI/voltageSI
