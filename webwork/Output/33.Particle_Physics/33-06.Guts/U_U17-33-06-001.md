## Question Section 

The intensity of cosmic ray radiation decreases rapidly with increasing energy, but there are occasionally extremely energetic cosmic rays that create a shower of radiation from all the particles they create by striking a nucleus in the atmosphere as seen in the figure given below. Suppose a cosmic ray particle having an energy of(10^10,(GeV) converts its energy into particles with masses averaging(MeV)(GeVc^2). 
a) How many particles are created? 
ans_rule(40)
b) If the particles rain down on a(Area)(km^2) area, how many particles are there per square meter?
