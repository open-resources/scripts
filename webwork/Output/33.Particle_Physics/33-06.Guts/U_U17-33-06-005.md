## Question Section 

The primary decay mode for the negative pion is(pi^-) &#8594;(mu^-)+(v_mu).
a) What is the energy release in(MeV) in this decay? 
b) Using conservation of momentum, how much energy does each of the decay products receive, given the(pi^-) is at rest when it decays? You may assume the muon antineutrino is massless and has momentum(p) =(Ec), just like a photon.
