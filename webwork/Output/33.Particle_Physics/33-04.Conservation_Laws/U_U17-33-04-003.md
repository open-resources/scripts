## Question Section 

The mass of a theoretical particle that may be associated with the unification of the
electroweak and strong forces is(10^14)(GeVc^2). 
a) How many proton masses is this?
ans_rule(40)
b) How many electron masses is this? (This indicates how extremely relativistic the
accelerator would have to be in order to make the particle, and how large the
relativistic quantity(gamma) would have to be.)
ans_rule(40)
