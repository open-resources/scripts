## Question Section 

At full energy, protons in the(diameter,(km) diameter Fermilab synchrotron travel at nearly
the speed of light, since their energy is about(1000) times their rest mass energy. 
a) How long does it take for a proton to complete one trip around? 
b) How many times per second will it pass through the target area?
