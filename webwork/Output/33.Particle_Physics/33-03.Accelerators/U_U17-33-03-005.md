## Question Section 

Because of energy loss due to synchrotron radiation in the LHC at CERN, only(MeV,(MeV) is added to the energy of each proton during each revolution around the main
ring. How many revolutions are needed to produce(TeV,(TeV) ((TeV1,(GeV) protons, if they are injected with an initial energy of(GeV,(GeV)?
