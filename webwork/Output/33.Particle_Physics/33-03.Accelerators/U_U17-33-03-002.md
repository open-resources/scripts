## Question Section 

Suppose a(W^-) created in a bubble chamber lives for(ttimes 10^-25,(s). What distance does it move in this time if it is traveling at(velocity,(c)? Since this distance is too short to make a track, the presence of the(W^-) must be inferred from its decay products. 
Note that the time is longer than the given(W^-) lifetime, which can be due to the statistical nature of decay or time dilation.
