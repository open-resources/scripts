## Question Section 

Verify the quantum numbers given for the(Omega^+) in Table 33.2 (in section 33.4 of OpenStax College Physics) by adding the quantum numbers for its quark constituents as inferred from Table 33.4 (in section 33.5 in OpenStax College Physics). Let(S) represent(s)&#772;.
(Omega^+) = + 
(L)<sub>e<sub>,(L)<sub>(mu)<sub>,(L)<sub>(tau)<sub> = +
(Q) = + ;(S) = +
