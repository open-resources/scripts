## Question Section 

One decay mode for the eta-zero meson is(eta^0) &#8594;(pi^0)+(pi^0). 
a) Write the decay in terms of the quark constituents, then calculate how much energy is released? 
b) What is the ultimate release of energy, given the decay mode for the pi zero is(pi^0) &#8594;(gamma)+(gamma)?
