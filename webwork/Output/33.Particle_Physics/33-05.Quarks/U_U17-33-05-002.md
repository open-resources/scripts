![Graph of a function.]("Figure_34_05_07.png")

Accelerators such as the Triangle Universities Meson Facility (TRIUMF) in British Columbia produce secondary beams of pions by having an intense primary proton beam strike a target. Such “meson factories” have been used for many years to study the interaction of pions with nuclei and, hence, the strong nuclear force. One reaction that occurs is(pi)<sup>+<sup> +(p) &#8594; <m
 

(a) Find this lifetime. 
(b) Verify from the quark composition of the particles that this reaction annihilates and then re-creates a d quark and a  antiquark by writing the reaction and decay in terms of quarks. Enter(u) for up quark, and(w) for it's antiparticle. Enter(d) for down quark, and(D) for it's antiparticle.
