## Question Section 

You may be required to add positive and negative numbers in this problem. If so, enter the positive number in the first box, and the negative number in the second.
(a) Find the charge, baryon number, strangeness, charm, and bottomness of the(J)(psi) particle from its quark composition. 
(J)(psi)((cc)&#772;):
(B) = =ans_rule(5) 
(Q) = =ans_rule(5)
(b,s) = =ans_rule(5)
(c) = =ans_rule(5)
(b) Do the same for the(Upsilon) particle.
(Upsilon)((bb)&#772;):
(B) = =ans_rule(5)
(Q) = =ans_rule(5)
(s,c) = =ans_rule(5)
(b) = =ans_rule(5)
