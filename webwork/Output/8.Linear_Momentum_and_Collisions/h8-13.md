## Question Section 

 
  
A block of mass(0.7) kg moving to the east with a speed of(4.6) ms collides elastically with a block of mass(0.7) kg that is initially at rest. Immediately after the collision, the first block moves at an angle of(40^circ) north of east. Determine the speed of the first block and the velocity of the second block immediately after the collision. 
speed of first block = ans_rule(20) ms  
speed of second block = ans_rule(20) ms  
angle of second block = ans_rule(20) degrees south of east

## C
north of east. Determine the speed of the first block and the velocity of the second block immediately after the collision.
