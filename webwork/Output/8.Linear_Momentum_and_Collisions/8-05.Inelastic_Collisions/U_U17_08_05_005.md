## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Two manned satellites approaching one another, at a relative speed of(v2,ms), intending to dock. The first has a mass of(m1atimes 10^3,kg), and the second a mass of(m2atimes 10^3,kg). 
Take the direction in which the second satellite was initially travelling as positive.
a) Calculate the final velocity (after docking) by using the frame of reference in which the first satellite was originally at rest. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.5,4.75,0.05))
m1 = m1a*(10**3)
m2a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7,7.25,0.05))
m2 = m2a*(10**3)
v2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.24,0.245,0.005))
v2c = -v2

v1 = (m2*v2)/(m1+m2)
KE = abs(-((1/2)*(m2*(v2**2)))+((1/2)*(m1+m2)*(v1**2)))
vc = (m1*v2c)/(m1+m2)
KEc = abs((0.5*(m1+m2)*(vc**2))-(0.5*(m1*(v2c**2))))
