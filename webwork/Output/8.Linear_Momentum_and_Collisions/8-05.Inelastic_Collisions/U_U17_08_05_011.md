## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Two football players collide head-on in midair while trying to catch a thrown football. The first player is(m1,kg) and has an initial velocity of(v1,ms), while the second player is(m2,kg) and has an initial velocity of(v2,ms). What is their velocity just after impact if they cling together?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,92.5,0.5))
m2 = randrange(110,115,1)
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(6.5,6.75,0.05))
v2 = sprintf("%0.2f", -randrange(4,4.25,0.05))

v = ((m1*v1)+(m2*v2))/(m1+m2)
