## Question Section 

<b>
During an ice show, a(m1-kg) skater leaps into the air and is caught by an initially stationary(m2-kg) skater. 
a) What is their final velocity assuming negligible friction and that the(m1-kg) skater's original horizontal velocity is(v1,ms)? 
ans_rule(40)(ms)

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(60,65,0.5))
m2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(70,75,0.5))
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.5,4,0.05))

v2 = (m1*v1)/(m1+m2)
KE = 0.5*(m1*v1**2 - (m1+m2)*v2**2)
