## Question Section 

<b>
A battleship that is(m2atimes 10^7,kg) and is originally at rest fires a(m1-kg) artillery shell horizontally with a velocity of(v1,ms).
a) If the shell is fired straight aft (toward the rear of the ship), there will be negligible friction opposing the ship's recoil. Calculate its recoil velocity.  
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(1100,1125,5)
m2a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(6,6.25,0.05))
m2 = m2a*(10**7)
v1 = randrange(575,600,5)

v2 = (m1*v1)/(m1+m2)
KE = ((1/2)*((m1*(v1**2))+(m2*(v2**2))))
