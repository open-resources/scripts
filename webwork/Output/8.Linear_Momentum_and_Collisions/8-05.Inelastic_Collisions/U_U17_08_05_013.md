## Question Section 

<b>
During a circus act, an elderly performer thrills the crowd by catching a cannon ball
shot at him. The cannon ball has a mass of(m1,kg) and the horizontal component of its velocity is(v1,ms) when the(m2-kg) performer catches it. If the performer is on nearly frictionless roller skates, what is his recoil velocity?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## G

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,12.5,0.5))
m2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(65,70,1))
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,8.25,0.05))

v = (m1*v1)/(m1+m2)
