## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,3.25,0.05))
m1 = m1a*(10**4)
m2a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
m2 = m2a*(10**5)
v1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.75,0.755,0.005))

v2 = (m1*v1)/(m1+m2)
KE = ((1/2)*(m1*(v1**2)))-((1/2)*(m1+m2)*(v2**2))
