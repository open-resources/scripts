## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Space probes may be separated from their launchers by exploding bolts. (They bolt away from one another.)
Suppose a(m1-kg) satellite uses this method to separate from the(m2-kg) remains of its launcher, and that(KE,J) of
kinetic energy is supplied to the two parts. 
a) What is the initial velocity of the satellite using the frame of reference in which both objects were at rest before separation?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(4200,4250,25)
m2 = randrange(1500,1550,25)
KE = randrange(5000,6000,500)

v1 = ((2*KE)/(m1+((m1**2)/m2)))**(1/2)
v2 = (-m1*v1)/m2
