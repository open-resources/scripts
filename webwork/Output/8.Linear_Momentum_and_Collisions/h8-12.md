## Question Section 

 
  
A block of mass(0.7) kg moving to the east with a speed of(4.6) ms collides with a block of mass(0.9) kg that is initially at rest. Immediately after the collision, the first block moves at a speed of(3.1) ms at an angle of(40^circ) north of east. Determine the velocity of the second block immediately after the collision. 
speed = ans_rule(20) ms  
angle = ans_rule(20) degrees south of east

## C
