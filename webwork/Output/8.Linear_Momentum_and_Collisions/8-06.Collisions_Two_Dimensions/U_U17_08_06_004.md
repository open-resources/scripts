## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> A(m1-kg) bowling ball moving at(v1,ms) collides with a(m2-kg) bowling pin, which is scattered at an angle of(phi ^circ) to the initial direction of the bowling ball and with a speed of(v22,ms).
a) Calculate the final velocity (magnitude and direction) of the bowling ball. 
ans_rule(40)(ms)
ans_rule(40) degrees from the initial direction of the bowling ball

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.5,5.75,0.05))
m2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.85,0.875,0.005))
v22 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,12.5,0.5))
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(9,9.25,0.05))
phi = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(80,82.5,0.5))
phir = phi*pi/180


fraction = csc(phir)*( cos(phir) - (m1*v1)/(m2*v22) )
thetar = arctan(1/fraction)
theta = thetar*180/pi
v11 = -( m2*v22*sin(phir) )/( m1*sin(thetar) )

KE1 = 0.5*(m1*v1**2)
KE2 = 0.5*( m1*v11**2 + m2*v22**2 )
ratio = KE1/KE2
