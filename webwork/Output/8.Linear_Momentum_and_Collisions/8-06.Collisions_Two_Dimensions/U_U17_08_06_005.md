## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Ernest Rutherford (the first New Zealander to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry) demonstrated that nuclei were very small and dense by scattering helium-4 nuclei,( ^4He), from gold-197 nuclei,( ^197Au). The energy of the incoming helium nucleus was(8.00times 10^-13,J), and the masses of the helium and gold nuclei were(6.68times 10^-27,kg) and(3.29times 10^-25,kg), respectively (note that their mass ratio is 4 to 197).
a) If a helium nucleus scatters to an angle of(theta1 ^circ) during an elastic collision with a gold nucleus, determine the angle at which the gold nucleus itself scatters.
ans_rule(40) degrees from the initial direction of the helium nucleus

## A
If a helium nucleus scatters to an angle of(theta1 ^circ) during an elastic collision with a gold nucleus, determine the angle at which the gold nucleus itself scatters.

and(3.29times 10^-25,kg), respectively (note that their mass ratio is 4 to 197).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = 6.68*(10**-27)
m2 = 3.29*(10**-25)
KE = 8*(10**-13)
v1 = ((2*KE)/m1)**(1/2)
theta1 = randrange(120,125,1)

v2 = 1.50*(10**7)
tantheta2 = (-v2*sin(theta1*(pi/180)))/(v1-(v2*cos(theta1*(pi/180))))
theta2 = atan(tantheta2)*(180/pi)
KEf = (0.5*m1*(v2**2))*10**13
