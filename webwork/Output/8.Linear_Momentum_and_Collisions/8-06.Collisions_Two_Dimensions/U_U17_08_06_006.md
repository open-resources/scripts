## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Two cars collide at an icy intersection and stick together afterward. The first car has a mass of(m1,kg) and is approaching at(v1,ms) due south. The second car has a mass of(m2,kg) and is approaching at(v2,ms) due west.
a) Calculate the final velocity direction of the cars. 
ans_rule(40) degrees South of West

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(1150,1250,25)
m2 = randrange(800,900,25)
KE = 8*(10**-13)
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.75,8,0.05))
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,17.5,0.5))

theta = atan((m1*v1)/(m2*v2))
theta1 = theta*(180/pi)
v = (m1*v1)/((m1+m2)*sin(theta))
KEi = 0.5*((m1*(v1**2))+(m2*(v2**2)))
KEf = 0.5*(m1+m2)*(v**2)
KE = abs(KEf-KEi)
