## Question Section 

<b>
A(m1-kg) ice hockey goalie, originally at rest, catches a(m2-kg) hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of(v2,ms). Suppose the goalie and the ice puck have an elastic collision and the puck is reflected back in the direction from which it came. 
a) What would the final velocity of the puck be in this case?
b) What would the final velocity of the goalie be in this case?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(75,80,0.5))
m2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.12,0.125,0.005))
v1 = 0
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(35, 40, 0.5))

v11 = (m1*v1-m2*v1+2*m2*v2)/(m1+m2)
v22 = (2*m1*v1-m1*v2+m2*v2)/(m1+m2)
