## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vab = randrange(60,70,1)
mass_airplane = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.25,2.75,0.05))
mass_airplaneSI = (mass_airplane)*10**4

momentum_airplane_1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
momentum_airplane_1SI = (momentum_airplane_1)*10**9

velocity_airplane_2SI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(65,70,0.5))

velocity_airplane_1SI = (momentum_airplane_1SI)/(mass_airplaneSI)
momentum_airplane_2SI = (mass_airplaneSI)*(velocity_airplane_2SI)
