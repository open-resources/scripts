### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass_shellSI = randrange(1000,1050,5)

momentum_ship = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
momentum_shipSI = momentum_ship*10**9

velocity_shellSI = randrange(1200,1250,5)
velocity_ship = randrange(45,50,1)
velocity_shipSI = (1/3.6)*velocity_ship

mass_shipSI = (momentum_shipSI)/(velocity_shipSI)
mass_ship = (mass_shipSI)*10**-8
momentum_shellSI = (mass_shellSI)*(velocity_shellSI)

ratio = (momentum_shipSI)/(momentum_shellSI)
