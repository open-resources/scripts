## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass_bulletSI = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.04,0.045,0.0005))
mass_elephantSI = randrange(2000,2200,5)
mass_hunterSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(85,95,1))

velocity_bulletSI = randrange(600,650,5)
velocity_elephantSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.5,8,0.05))
velocity_hunterSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.25,7.75,0.05))

momentum_bulletSI = (mass_bulletSI)*(velocity_bulletSI)
momentum_elephantSI = (mass_elephantSI)*(velocity_elephantSI)
momentum_hunterSI = (mass_hunterSI)*(velocity_hunterSI)

ratio = (momentum_elephantSI/momentum_bulletSI)
