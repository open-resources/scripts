## Question Section 

<b>
A runaway train car that has a mass of(mass_traintimes 10^4,kg) travels at a speed of(velocity_trainSI,ms) down a track. Compute the time required for a force of(forcetimes 10^3,N) to bring the car to rest.
ans_rule(40)(s)

## G
travels at a speed of(velocity_trainSI,ms) down a track. Compute the time required for a force of(forcetimes 10^3,N) to bring the car to rest.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

force = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.5,2,0.05))
forceSI = (force)*10**3
mass_train = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(1.5,1.55,0.005))
mass_trainSI = (mass_train)*10**4
velocity_trainSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.25,5.75,0.05))

delta_momentumSI = (mass_trainSI)*(velocity_trainSI)
delta_timeSI = (delta_momentumSI)/(forceSI)
