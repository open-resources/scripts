## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a clay model of a koala bear has a mass of(m1,kg) and slides on ice at a speed of(v1,ms). It runs into another clay model, which is initially motionless and has a mass of(m2,kg). Both being soft clay, they naturally stick together. What is their final velocity?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.25,0.3,0.005))
v1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.75,0.8,0.05))
m2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.35,0.4,0.005))

v2 = (m1*v1)/(m2+m1)
