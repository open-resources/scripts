## Question Section 

<b>
A(m1-kg) falcon catches a(m2-kg) dove from behind in midair. What is their velocity after impact if the falcon's velocity is initially(v1,ms) and the dove's velocity is(v2,ms) in the same direction?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.5))
v2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(6,9,1))
m1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(1.80,1.85,0.005))
m2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.6,0.5,0.005))

v = ((m1*v1)+(m2*v2))/(m1+m2)
