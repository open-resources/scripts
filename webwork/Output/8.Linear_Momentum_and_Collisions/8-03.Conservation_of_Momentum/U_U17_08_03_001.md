## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Train cars are coupled together by being bumped into one another. Suppose two loaded train cars are moving toward one another, the first having a mass of(m1 ,! 000,kg) and a velocity of(v1,ms), and the second having a mass of(m2 ,! 000,kg) and a velocity of(v2,ms). (The minus indicates direction of motion.) What is their final velocity?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v1 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.3,0.35,0.005))
v2 = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(-0.2,-0.25,0.005))

m1 = randrange(130,150,5)
m2 = randrange(100,120,5)

M1 = m1*10**3
M2 = m2*10**3

v = ((M1*v1)+(M2*v2))/(M1+M2)
