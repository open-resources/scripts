## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Consider the following question: A car moving at(v,ms) crashes into a tree and stops in(t,s). Calculate the force the seatbelt exerts on a passenger in the car to bring him to a halt. The mass of the passenger is(m,kg).
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(70,80,1)
v = randrange(10,17,1)
t = randrange(0.2,0.3,0.01)

F = -(m*v)/t
