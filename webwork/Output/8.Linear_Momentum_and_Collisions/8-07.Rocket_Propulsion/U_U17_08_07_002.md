## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> What is the acceleration of a(m-kg) rocket taking off from the Moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is only(g,ms^2), if the rocket expels(mt,kg) of gas per second at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms)?
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)

## G

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(4250,4500,50)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,2.75,0.05))
v = va*(10**3)
g = 1.62
mt = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(6.5,9,0.05))

a = (v*mt/m)-g
