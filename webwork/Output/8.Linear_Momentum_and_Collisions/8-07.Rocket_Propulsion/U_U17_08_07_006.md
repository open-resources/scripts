## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Calculate the maximum rate at which a rocket can expel gases if its acceleration cannot exceed seven times that of gravity. The mass of the rocket just as it runs out of fuel is(m,kg), and its exhaust velocity is(vatimes 10^3,ms). Assume that the acceleration of gravity is the same as on Earth's surface(g,ms^2).
ans_rule(40)(kgs)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(70000,70250,50)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.25,2.5,0.05))
v = va*(10**3)
g = sprintf("%0.2f", 9.8)

mt = (g*m*8)/v
