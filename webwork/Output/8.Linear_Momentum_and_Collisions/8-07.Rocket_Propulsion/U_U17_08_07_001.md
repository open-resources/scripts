## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Antiballistic missiles (ABMs) are designed to have very large accelerations so that they may intercept fast-moving incoming missiles in the short time available. What is the takeoff acceleration of a(m-kg) ABM that expels(mt,kg) of gas per second at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms)?
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)

## G
ABM that expels(mt,kof gas per second at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(10000,10250,50)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.25,0.05))
mt = randrange(175,200,5)
v = va*(10**3)
g = 9.8

a = (v*mt/m)-g
