## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> Calculate the increase in velocity of a(mo-kg) space probe that expels(m1,kg) of its mass at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms). You may assume the gravitational force is negligible at the probe's location.
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## G
space probe that expels(m1,kof its mass at an exhaust velocity of(vatimes 10^3,ms). You may assume the gravitational force is negligible at the probe's location.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mo = randrange(4000,4250,20)
va = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.5,2.75,0.05))
v = va*(10**3)
m1 = randrange(3250,3500,50)

m = mo-m1
v1 = v*ln(mo/m)
