## Question Section 

<b>
A cruise ship with a mass of(matimes 10^7,kg) strikes a pier at a speed of(vo,ms). It comes to rest(x,m) later, damaging the ship, the pier, and the tugboat captain's finances. Calculate the average force exerted on the pier using the concept of impulse.
ans_rule(40)(N)

## G
strikes a pier at a speed of(vo,ms). It comes to rest(x,m) later, damaging the ship, the pier, and the tugboat captain's finances. Calculate the average force exerted on the pier using the concept of impulse.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

ma = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
m = ma*(10**7)
vo = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.75,1,0.05))
x = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,6,1))
t = (2*x)/vo
vf = -(m*(0-vo))/t
