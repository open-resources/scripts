## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the final speed of a(m-kg) rugby player who is initially running at(vi,ms) but collides head-on with a padded goalpost and experiences a backward force of(Fatimes 10^4,N) for(tatimes 10^-2,s).
ans_rule(40)(ms)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Fa = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.25,0.05))
F = Fa*(10**4)
ta = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,5.5,0.05))
t = ta*(10**-2)
m = randrange(100,120,10)
vi = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(6,9,1))
p = F*t
vf = abs((p/m)-vi)
