## Question Section 

<b>
A bullet is accelerated down the barrel of a gun by hot gases produced in the
combustion of gun powder. What is the average force exerted on a(m-kg) bullet to accelerate it to a speed of(v,ms) in a time of(tms,ms)?
ans_rule(40)(N)

## G
bullet to accelerate it to a speed of(v,ms) in a time of(tms,ms)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.03,0.04,0.0005))
v = randrange(550,650,10)
tms = randrange(2,4,1)
t = tms*(10**-3)
F = (m*v)/t
