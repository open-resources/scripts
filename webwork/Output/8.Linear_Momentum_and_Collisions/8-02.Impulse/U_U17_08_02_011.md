## Question Section 

<b>
Water from a fire hose is directed horizontally against a wall at a rate of(m,kgs) and a speed of(v,ms). Calculate the force exerted on the wall, assuming the water's horizontal momentum is reduced to zero.
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(50,60,1)
v = randrange(42,46,1)
F = m*v
