## Question Section 

<b>
A punter drops a ball from rest vertically(x,m) down onto his foot. The ball leaves the foot with a speed of(v,ms) at an angle(angle ^circ) above the horizontal. In which direction does the impulse act?
ans_rule(40) degrees above the horizontal

## C
above the horizontal. In which direction does the impulse act?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

x = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.8,1.9,0.01))
g = 9.8
vi = sqrt(2*g*x)
v = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(16,19,1))
angle = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(50,52.5,0.5))
vx = v*cos(angle*(pi/180))
vy = v*sin(angle*(pi/180))
deltavy = vy+vi
theta = (atan(deltavy/vx))*(180/pi)
