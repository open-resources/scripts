## Question Section 

<b>
A person slaps her leg with her hand, bringing her hand to rest in(tms) milliseconds
from an initial speed of(v,ms). What is the average force exerted on the leg, taking the effective mass of the hand and forearm to be(m,kg)?
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.50,1.75,0.05))
v = randrange(3,5,1)
tms = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
t = tms*(10**-3)
F = (-m*v)/t
