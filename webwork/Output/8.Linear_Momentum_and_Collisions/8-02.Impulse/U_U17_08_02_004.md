<b>
<b>Professional Application:<b> A professional boxer hits his opponent with a(F-N) horizontal blow that lasts for(t,s).
a) Calculate the impulse imparted by this blow.
b) What is the opponent's final velocity, if his mass is(mb,kg)  and he is motionless in midair when struck near his center of mass?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

F = randrange(1000,1100,5)
mb = randrange(100,105,1)
t = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.15,0.175,0.005))
mc = randrange(10,15,1)

p = F*t
vb = p/mb
vc = p/mc
