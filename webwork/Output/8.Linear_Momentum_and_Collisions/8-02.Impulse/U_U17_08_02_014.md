## Question Section 

<b>
A ball with an initial velocity of(v,ms) moves at an angle(60 ^circ) above the positive(x -)direction. The ball hits a vertical wall and bounces off so that it is moving(60 ^circ) above the negative(x -)direction with the same speed. What is the magnitude of the impulse delivered by the wall?
ans_rule(40)(times m;kgcdotms)

## C

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v = randrange(10,19,1)
