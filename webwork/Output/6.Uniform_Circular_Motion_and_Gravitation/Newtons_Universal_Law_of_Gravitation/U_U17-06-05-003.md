## Question Section 

<b>
a) What is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon? Take the mass of the Moon and its radius to be(7.348times 10^22)(kg) and(1.737times 10^3)(km), respectively.
b) On the surface of Mars? Take the mass of Mars and its radius to be(6.418times 10^23)(kg) and(3.390times 10^3)(km), respectively.

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

g_MoonSI = ((6.674*7.348)/(1.737**2))*10**-1
g_MarsSI = ((6.674*6.418)/(3.390**2))
