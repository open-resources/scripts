## A
Calculate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Sun. Take the mass of Sun and its radius to be(1.989times 10^30)(kg) and(6.955times 10^5)(km).
### Answer Section
## G
and(6.955times 10^5)(km).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

g = 9.8

g_Sun = ((6.674*1.989)/(6.955**2))*10**3
n = (g_Sun/g)
