## Question Section 

<b>
The Moon and Earth rotate about their common center of mass, which is located about(4700)(km) from the center of Earth. (This is(1690)(km) below the surface.)
a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to the Moon's gravity at that point. Take the mass of the Moon and the distance separating the centres of the Earth and Moon to be(7.348times 10^22)(kg) and(3.844times 10^5)(km), respectively.
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

g_from_MoonSI = ((6.674*7.348)/(3.797**2))*10**-5

omegaSI = ((2*pi)/(27.3*86400))
radial_accelerationSI = (4700*10**3)*(omegaSI)**2
