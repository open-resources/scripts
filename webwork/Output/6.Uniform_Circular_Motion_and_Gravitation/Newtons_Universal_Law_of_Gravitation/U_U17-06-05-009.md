## Question Section 

<b>
The Sun orbits the Milky Way galaxy once each(2.60times 10^8) years, with a roughly circular orbit averaging(3.00times 10^4) light years in radius. (A light year is the distance traveled by light in one year.) 
a) Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the Sun in its galactic orbit. Does your result support the
contention that a nearly inertial frame of reference can be located at the Sun?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

c = 3*10**8
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
seconds_per_year = (365.25*86400)

light_year = (c*seconds_per_year)
radiusSI = (3*10**4*light_year)

omegaSI = (2*pi)/(2.6*10**8*seconds_per_year)
radial_accelerationSI = (radiusSI)*(omegaSI**2)
velocitySI = (omegaSI*radiusSI)
