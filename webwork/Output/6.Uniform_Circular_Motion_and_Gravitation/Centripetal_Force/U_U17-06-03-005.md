and taken at(velocitySI)(ms), assuming it is ideally banked?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

turn_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(60,75,5))
turn_rads = turn_degrees*(pi/180)
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(35,40,5))

radiusSI = (velocitySI**2)/(g*tan(turn_rads))
radial_accelerationSI = (velocitySI**2)/(radiusSI)
