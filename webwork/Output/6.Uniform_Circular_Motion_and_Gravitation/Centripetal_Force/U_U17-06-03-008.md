## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> If a car takes a banked curve at less than the ideal speed, friction is needed to keep it from sliding toward the inside of the curve (a real problem on icy mountain roads).
a) Calculate the ideal speed to take a(radiusSI)(m) radius curve banked at(theta_degrees^circ).
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## A
Calculate the ideal speed to take a(radiusSI)(m) radius curve banked at(theta_degrees^circ).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(90,5,100))
theta_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,15,1))
theta_rads = theta_degrees*(pi/180)
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(7.5,10,0.5))

velocity_idealSI = sqrt(g*radiusSI*tan(theta_rads))
mu_minimum = (g*radiusSI*tan(theta_rads)-(velocitySI**2))/((velocitySI**2)*tan(theta_rads)+(g*radiusSI))
