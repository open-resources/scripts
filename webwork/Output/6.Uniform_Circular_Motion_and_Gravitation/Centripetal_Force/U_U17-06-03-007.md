![NASA Centrifuge]("NU_U17-06-03-007.png")

<b>
A large centrifuge, like the one shown in Figure (a) above, is used to expose aspiring astronauts to accelerations similar to those experienced in rocket launches and atmospheric reentries.
a) At what angular velocity is the centripetal acceleration(n)(g) if the rider is(radiusSI)(m) from the center of rotation?
ans_rule(40)(rads)

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8
n = randrange(8,12,1)

radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12.5,15,0.5))

omegaSI = sqrt((g*n)/(radiusSI))
theta_rads = acot(n)
theta_degrees = theta_rads*(180/pi)
