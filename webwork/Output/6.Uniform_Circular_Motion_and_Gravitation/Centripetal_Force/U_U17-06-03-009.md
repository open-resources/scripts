![Modern Roller Coaster]("NU_U17-06-03-009.png")

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in the figure above. The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. 
a) What is the speed of the roller coaster at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is(radiusSI)(m) and the downward acceleration of the car is(n)(g)?
ans_rule(40)(ms)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8
n = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(1.5,2.5,0.5))
x = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,5,0.25))        #Part (c) additional height.

massSI = randrange(1500,2000,100)
radial_accelerationSI = (g*n)
radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12.5,15,0.5))

speedSI = sqrt(radial_accelerationSI*radiusSI)
heightSI = 0.5*(n*radiusSI)
friction_workSI = (g*massSI*x)
friction_work = friction_workSI*10**-3
