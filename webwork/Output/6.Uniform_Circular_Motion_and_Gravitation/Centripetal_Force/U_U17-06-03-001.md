## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

child_massSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(20,25,1))
radius_aSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.5,0.05))
radius_bSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(6,6.5,0.05))
rpm_a = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(35,40,1))
rpm_b = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3,5,1))

omega_aSI = rpm_a*(2*pi/60)
omega_bSI = rpm_b*(2*pi/60)

centripetal_force_aSI = (omega_aSI**2)*(child_massSI*radius_aSI)
centripetal_force_bSI = (omega_bSI**2)*(child_massSI*radius_bSI)
