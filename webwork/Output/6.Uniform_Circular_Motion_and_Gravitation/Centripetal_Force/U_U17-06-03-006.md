![Forces on Cyclist]("NU_U17-06-03-006.png")

<b>
Part of riding a bicycle involves leaning at the correct angle when making a turn, as seen in the figure above. To be stable, the force exerted by the ground must be on a line going through the center of gravity. The force on the bicycle wheel can be resolved into two perpendicular components—friction parallel to the road and the vertical normal force.
Calculate <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";><i>&theta;<i><span> (as defined in the figure) for a(radiusSI)-(m) radius turn taken at(velocitySI)(ms).
ans_rule(40) &#176;

## E
for a(radiusSI)-(m) radius turn taken at(velocitySI)(ms).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,35,1))
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12.5,15,0.5))

theta_rads = atan((velocitySI**2)/(g*radiusSI))
theta_degrees = theta_rads*(180/pi)
