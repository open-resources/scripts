## Question Section 

<b>
In lacrosse, a ball is thrown from a net on the end of a stick by rotating the stick and forearm about the elbow. If the angular velocity of the ball about the elbow joint is(omegaSI)(rads) and the ball is(stick_radiusSI)(m) from the elbow joint, what is the linear velocity of the ball?
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

omegaSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,35,0.5))
stick_radiusSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.2,1.3,0.01))

velocitySI = (omegaSI*stick_radiusSI)
