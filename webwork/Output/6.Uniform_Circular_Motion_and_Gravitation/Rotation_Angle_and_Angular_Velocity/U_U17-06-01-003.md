## Question Section 

<b>
An automobile with(wheel_radiusSI)(m) radius tires travels(distancetimes 10^4)(km) before wearing them out. How many revolutions do the tires make, neglecting any backing up and any change in radius due to wear? 
ans_rule(40) revolutions



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(8,9,0.1))
distanceSI = distance*10**7
wheel_radiusSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.2,0.25,0.005))

wheel_circumferenceSI = (2*pi*wheel_radiusSI)
revolutions = (distanceSI/wheel_circumferenceSI)
