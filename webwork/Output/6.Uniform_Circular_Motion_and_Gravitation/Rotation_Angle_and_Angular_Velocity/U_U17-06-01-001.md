## Question Section 

<b>
Semi-trailer trucks have an odometer on one hub of a trailer wheel. The hub is weighted so that it does not rotate, but it contains gears to count the number of wheel revolutionsâ€”it then calculates the distance traveled. If the wheel has a(wheel_diameterSI)(m) diameter and goes through(wheel_rotationstimes 10^5) revolutions, how many kilometers should the odometer read? 
ans_rule(40)(km)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wheel_diameterSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.2,0.05))
wheel_rotations  = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.05))
wheel_rotationsSI = wheel_rotations*10**5 

wheel_circumferenceSI = (wheel_diameterSI*pi)
distanceSI = (wheel_circumferenceSI*wheel_rotationsSI)
distance = distanceSI*10**-3
