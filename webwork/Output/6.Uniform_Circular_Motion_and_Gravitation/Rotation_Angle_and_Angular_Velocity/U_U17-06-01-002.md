## Question Section 

<b>
You observe a microwave oven rotating at a rate of about(omega)(rpm). What is this angular velocity in radians per second? 
ans_rule(40)(rads)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

omega = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(6,7,0.1))

omegaSI = (omega)*(2*pi/60)
