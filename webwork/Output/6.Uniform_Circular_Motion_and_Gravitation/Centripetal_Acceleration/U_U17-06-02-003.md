## Question Section 

<b>
Taking the age of Earth to be about (4times 10^9) years and assuming its orbital radius of (1.5times 10^11)(m) has not changed and is circular, calculate the approximate total distance Earth has traveled since its birth (in a frame of reference stationary with respect to the Sun). 
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

showHint = 3

distanceSI = (1.5)*(2*pi)*(4)*(10**(20))
