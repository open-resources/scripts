## Question Section 

<b>
A rotating space station is said to create “artificial gravity”—a loosely-defined term used for an acceleration that would be crudely similar to gravity. The outer wall of the rotating space station would become a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor would allow astronauts to exercise and maintain muscle and bone strength more naturally than in non-rotating space environments. If the space station is(diameterSI)(m) in diameter, what angular velocity would produce an “artificial gravity” of (g)(ms^2) at the rim?
ans_rule(40)(rads)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

diameterSI = randrange(175,200,5)

omegaSI = sqrt((2*g)/diameterSI)
