## Question Section 

<b>
Olympic ice skaters are able to spin at about(rps_skaters)(revs).
a) What is their angular velocity in radians per second?
b) What is the centripetal acceleration of the skater's nose if it is(radiusSI)(m) from the axis of rotation?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

radiusSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.1,0.15,0.005))
rps_DB = 9
rps_skaters = 5

omega_DBSI = (rps_DB*2*pi)
omega_skatersSI = (rps_skaters*2*pi)
radial_acceleration_DBSI = (omega_DBSI**2)*(radiusSI)
radial_acceleration_skatersSI = (omega_skatersSI**2)*(radiusSI)
