## Question Section 

<b>
A runner taking part in the(distanceSI)(m) dash must run around the end of a track that has a circular arc with a radius of curvature of(radiusSI)(m). If he completes the(distanceSI)(m) dash in(timeSI)(s) and runs at constant speed throughout the race, what is his centripetal acceleration as he runs the curved portion of the track?
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

distanceSI = 200
radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(30,35,1))
timeSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(28,30,0.5))

velocitySI = (distanceSI/timeSI)
radial_accelerationSI = (velocitySI**2)/(radiusSI)
