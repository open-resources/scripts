## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A mother pushes her child on a swing so that his speed is(velocitySI)(ms) at the lowest point of his path. The swing is suspended(radiusSI)(m) above the child's center of mass. 
a) What is the centripetal acceleration of the child at the low point?
ans_rule(40)(ms^2)

## A
What is the centripetal acceleration of the child at the low point?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

child_massSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(13,18,0.5))
radiusSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.25,0.05))
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,10,0.25))

radial_accelerationSI = (velocitySI**2)/(radiusSI)
normal_forceSI = (child_massSI)*(g+radial_accelerationSI)
