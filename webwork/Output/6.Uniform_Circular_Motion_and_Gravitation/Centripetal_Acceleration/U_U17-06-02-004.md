## Question Section 

<b>
The propeller of a World War II fighter plane is(propeller_diameterSI)(m) in diameter.
a) What is its angular velocity in radians per second if it spins at(rpm)(rpm)?
b) What is the linear speed of its tip at this angular velocity if the plane is stationary on the tarmac?

## A
What is its angular velocity in radians per second if it spins at(rpm)(rpm)?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the linear speed of its tip at this angular velocity if the plane is stationary on the tarmac?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

propeller_diameterSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.2,3.3,0.01))
propeller_radiusSI = 0.5*propeller_diameterSI
rpm = randrange(1200,1400,50)

omegaSI = (rpm)*(2*pi/60)
velocitySI = (omegaSI*propeller_radiusSI)
radial_accelerationSI = (omegaSI**2)*(propeller_radiusSI)
n = (radial_accelerationSI)/(g)
