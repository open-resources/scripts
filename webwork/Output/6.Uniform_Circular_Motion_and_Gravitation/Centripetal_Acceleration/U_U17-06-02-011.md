### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

diameterSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.6,0.65,0.025))
mass_bacterium = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,2,0.25))
mass_bacteriumSI = mass_bacterium*10**-15
radiusSI = 0.5*diameterSI
velocitySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(70,75,0.5))

omegaSI = (velocitySI)/(radiusSI)
rpm = (omegaSI*60/(2*pi))
radial_accelerationSI = (omegaSI**2)*(radiusSI)
forceSI =(mass_bacteriumSI*radial_accelerationSI)
ratio = (radial_accelerationSI/g)
