## Question Section 

<b>
What percentage of the acceleration at Earth's surface is the acceleration due to gravity at the position of a satellite located(satellite_distance)(km) above Earth? Take the radius of the Earth to be(Earth_radiustimes 10^6)(m).
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Earth_radius = 6.38
Earth_radiusSI = Earth_radius*10**6
satellite_distance = randrange(250,350,25)
satellite_distanceSI = satellite_distance*10**3

percent = (Earth_radiusSI/(Earth_radiusSI+satellite_distanceSI))**2*100
