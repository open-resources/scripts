## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the linear speed of the Earth in its orbit about the Sun. Take the distance to the Sun to be(1.496times 10^11)(m).
ans_rule(40)(kms)



## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Earth_periodSI = (365.25*86400)
Sun_distance = 1.496
Sun_distanceSI = Sun_distance*10**11

omegaSI = ((2*pi)/Earth_periodSI)
velocitySI = (omegaSI*Sun_distanceSI)
velocity = (velocitySI*10**-3)
