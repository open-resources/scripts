## Question Section 

<b>
Helicopter blades withstand tremendous stresses. In addition to supporting the weight of a helicopter, they are spun at rapid rates and experience large centripetal accelerations, especially at the tip. Calculate the centripetal acceleration at the tip of a(blade_lengthSI)(m) long helicopter blade that rotates at(rpm)(rpm). 
ans_rule(40)(rads^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

blade_lengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4,6,0.25))
rpm = randrange(250,350,25)

omegaSI = rpm*(2*pi/60)
radial_accelerationSI = (omegaSI**2)*(blade_lengthSI)
