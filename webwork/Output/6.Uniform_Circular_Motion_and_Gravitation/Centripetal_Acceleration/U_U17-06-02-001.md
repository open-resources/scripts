## Question Section 

<b>
A fairground ride spins its occupants inside a flying saucer-shaped container. If the horizontal circular path the riders follow has an(radiusSI)(m) radius, at how many revolutions per minute will the riders be subjected to a centripetal acceleration(n) times that due to gravity?
ans_rule(40)(rpm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8
n = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.25,2,0.2))            #Multiple of gravity.

radiusSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(8,10,0.5))

omegaSI = sqrt((n*g)/radiusSI)
omega = omegaSI*(60/(2*pi))
