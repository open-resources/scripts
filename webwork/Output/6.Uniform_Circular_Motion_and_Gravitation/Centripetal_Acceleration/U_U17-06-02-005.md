<b>
An ordinary workshop grindstone has a radius of(radius)(cm) and rotates at(rpm)(rpm).
a) Calculate the centripetal acceleration at its edge in multiples of(g).
ans_rule(40)(g)

## A
Calculate the centripetal acceleration at its edge in multiples of(g).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8

radius = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7,8,0.05))
radiusSI = radius*10**-2
rpm = randrange(5000,6000,500)

omegaSI = rpm*(2*pi/60)
radial_accelerationSI = (omegaSI**2)*(radiusSI)
n = radial_accelerationSI/g
velocitySI = (omegaSI*radiusSI)
