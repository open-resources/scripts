## Question Section 

An LC circuit with a(capacitance,(pF) capacitor oscillates in such a manner as to radiate at a wavelength of(wavelength,(m).
a) What is the resonant frequency?
 
b) What inductance is in series with the capacitor?
(H)

## A
What is the resonant frequency?
### Answer Section
## B
What inductance is in series with the capacitor?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = randrange(4.75,5.25,0.01)
wavelength = randrange(3.1,3.5,0.01)

E = (3*10**8)/wavelength
F = (1/(4*(pi**2)*(capacitance*10**-12)*E**2))*10**6
