## Question Section 

 
The peak magnetic field strength in a residential microwave oven is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T).
What is the intensity of the microwave?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(9,9.4,0.01)

E = ((3*10**8)*((strength*10**-5)**2))/(2*(4*pi*10**-7))
