## Question Section 

A(turns)-turn flat coil of wire(diameter,(cm) in diameter acts as an antenna for FM radio at a frequency of(frequency,(MHz). The magnetic field of the incoming electromagnetic wave is perpendicular to the coil and has a maximum strength of(strength)(times 10^-12,(T).
a) What power is incident on the coil?
(W)
 
b) What average emf is induced in the coil over one-fourth of a cycle?
 
c) If the radio receiver has an inductance of(inductance)(mu)(H), what capacitance must it have to resonate at(frequency)(MHz)?
(F)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(175,225)
diameter = randrange(25,35,0.1)
frequency = randrange(90,110,1)
strength = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
inductance = randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01)
radius = (diameter*10**-2)/2
power = (((3*10**8)*((strength*10**-12)**2))/(2*(4*pi*10**-7)))*(pi*radius**2)
time = (1/4)*(1/(frequency*10**6))

E = power*10**12
F = (turns*pi*(radius**2)*(strength*10**-12))/time
G = (1/(4*(pi**2)*(inductance*10**-6)*((frequency*10**6)**2)))*10**12
