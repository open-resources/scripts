## Question Section 

A(diameter,(m) diameter university communications satellite dish receives TV signals that have a maximum electric field strength (for one channel) of(strength)(mu)(Vm).
a) What is the intensity of this wave?
(Wm^2)
 
b) What is the power received by the antenna?
(W)
 
c) If the orbiting satellite broadcasts uniformly over an area of(area)(times 10^13,(m^2) (a large fraction of North America), how much power does it radiate?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(2.4,2.6,0.01)
strength = randrange(7.4,7.6,0.01)
area = randrange(1.4,1.6,0.01)
radius = diameter/2
intensity = ((3*10**8)*(8.85*10**-12)*(strength*10**-6)**2)/2

E = intensity*10**14
F = (intensity*pi*radius**2)*10**13
G = intensity*(area*10**13)
