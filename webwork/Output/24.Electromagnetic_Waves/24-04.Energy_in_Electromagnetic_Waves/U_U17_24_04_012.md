## Question Section 

Police radar determines the speed of motor vehicles using the same Doppler-shift technique employed for ultrasound in medical diagnostics. Beats are produced by mixing the double Doppler-shifted echo with the original frequency. If(frequency_micro)(times 10^9,(Hz) microwaves are used and a beat frequency of(frequency_beat,(Hz) is produced, what is the speed of the vehicle? (Assume the same Doppler-shift formulas are valid with the speed of sound replaced by the speed of light.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency_micro = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
frequency_beat = randrange(140,160,1)

E = ((3*10**8)/2)*(frequency_beat/(frequency_micro*10**9))
