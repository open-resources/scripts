## Question Section 

 
An LC circuit containing a(capacitance,(pF) capacitor oscillates at such a frequency that it radiates at a(wavelength,(nm) wavelength.
What is the inductance of the circuit?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
wavelength = randrange(250,350,10)

E = (((wavelength*10**-9)**2)/(4*(pi**2)*(capacitance*10**-12)*(3*10**8)**2))*10**20
