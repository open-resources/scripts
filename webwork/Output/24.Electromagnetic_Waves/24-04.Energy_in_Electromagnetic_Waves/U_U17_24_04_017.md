## Question Section 

If electric and magnetic field strengths vary sinusoidally in time, being zero at(t = 0) , then(E = E_0sin2pi ft) and(B = B_0sin2pi ft) . Let(f =)(frequency,(GHz).
a) When are the field strengths first zero?
 
b) When do they reach their most negative value?
 
c) How much time is needed for them to complete one cycle?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

E = 0
F = (3/4)/(frequency*10**9)
G = 1/(frequency*10**9)
