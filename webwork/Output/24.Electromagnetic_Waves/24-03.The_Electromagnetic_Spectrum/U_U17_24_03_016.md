## Question Section 

The ideal size (most efficient) for a broadcast antenna with one end on the ground is one-fourth the wavelength ((lambda) 4 ) of the electromagnetic radiation being sent out. If a new radio station has such an antenna that is(distance,(m) high.
At what frequency does it broadcast most efficiently?

## A
4 ) of the electromagnetic radiation being sent out. If a new radio station has such an antenna that is(distance,(m) high.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(45,55,0.1)

E = (3*10**8)/(distance*4)
