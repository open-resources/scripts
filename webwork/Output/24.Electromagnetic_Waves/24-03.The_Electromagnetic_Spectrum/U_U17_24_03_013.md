## Question Section 

Distances in space are often quoted in units of light years, the distance light travels in one year.
a) How many meters is a light year?
b) How many meters is it to Andromeda, the nearest large galaxy, given that it is(distance_a)(times 10^6) light years away?
c) The most distant galaxy yet discovered is(distance_b)(times 10^9) light years away. How far is this in meters?

## A
How many meters is a light year?
### Answer Section
## B
How many meters is it to Andromeda, the nearest large galaxy, given that it is(distance_a)(times 10^6) light years away?
### Answer Section
## C
The most distant galaxy yet discovered is(distance_b)(times 10^9) light years away. How far is this in meters?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance_a = randrange(1.9,2.1,0.01)
distance_b = randrange(11.8,12.2)

E = (3*10**8)*365.25*24*3600
F = (distance_a*10**6)*E
G = (distance_b*10**9)*E
