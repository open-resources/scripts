## Question Section 

A radar used to detect the presence of aircraft receives a pulse that has reflected off an object(time)(times 10^-5,(s) after it was transmitted. What is the distance from the radar station to the reflecting object?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(5,7,1)

E = 0.5*(3*10**8)*(time*10**-5)
