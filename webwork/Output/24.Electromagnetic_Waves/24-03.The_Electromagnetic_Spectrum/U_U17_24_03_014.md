## Question Section 

A certain(frequency,(Hz) AC power line radiates an electromagnetic wave having a maximum electric field strength of(strength,(kVm).
a) What is the wavelength of this very low frequency electromagnetic wave?
b) What is its maximum magnetic field strength?

## A
What is the wavelength of this very low frequency electromagnetic wave?
### Answer Section
## B
What is its maximum magnetic field strength?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = randrange(48,52,0.5)
strength = randrange(11,15,0.5)

E = (3*10**8)/frequency
F = (strength*10**3)/(3*10**8)
