## Question Section 

During normal beating, the heart creates a maximum(voltage,(mV) potential across(distance,(m) of a person's chest, creating a(frequency,(Hz) electromagnetic wave.
a) What is the maximum electric field strength created?
b) What is the corresponding maximum magnetic field strength in the electromagnetic wave?
c) What is the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave?

## A
What is the maximum electric field strength created?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the corresponding maximum magnetic field strength in the electromagnetic wave?
### Answer Section
## C
What is the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(3.75,4.25,0.05)
distance = randrange(0.250,0.350,0.005)
frequency = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

E = (voltage*10**-3)/distance
F = E/(3*10**8)
G = (3*10**8)/frequency
