## Question Section 

Calculate the ratio of the highest to lowest frequencies of electromagnetic waves the eye can see, given the wavelength range of visible light is from(wavelength_a) to(wavelength_b,(nm).
ans_rule(40)

## A
to(wavelength_b,(nm).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength_a = randrange(370,390,5)
wavelength_b = wavelength_a*2

E = 2
