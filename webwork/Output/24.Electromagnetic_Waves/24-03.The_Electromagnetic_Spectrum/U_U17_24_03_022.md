## Question Section 

Radar is used to determine distances to various objects by measuring the round-trip time for an echo from the object.
a) How far away is the planet Venus if the echo time is(time,(s)?
 
b) What is the echo time for a car(distance_car,(m) from a Highway Police radar unit? 
(s)
 
c) How accurately (in nanoseconds) must you be able to measure the echo time to an airplane(distance_plane,(km) away to determine its distance within(range,(m)?

## A

### Answer Section
## B
What is the echo time for a car(distance_car,(m) from a Highway Police radar unit? 
### Answer Section
## C
How accurately (in nanoseconds) must you be able to measure the echo time to an airplane(distance_plane,(km) away to determine its distance within(range,(m)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(900,1100,50)
distance_car = randrange(70,80,0.1)
distance_plane = randrange(11,13,0.1)
range = randrange(10,15,1)

E = (3*10**8)*(time/2)
F = ((2*distance_car)/(3*10**8))*10**6
G = ((2*range)/(3*10**8))*10**9
