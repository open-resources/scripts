## Question Section 

Determine the amount of time it takes for X-rays of frequency(frequency)(times 10^18,(Hz) to travel:
a)(distance_a)(mm)
b)(distance_b)(cm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = randrange(2.5,3.5,0.1)
distance_a = randrange(1,3,1)
distance_b = randrange(1,3,1)

E = (distance_a*10**-3)/(3*10**8)
F = (distance_b*10**-2)/(3*10**8)
