## Question Section 

Two microwave frequencies are authorized for use in microwave ovens:(frequency_a) and(frequency_b,(MHz). Calculate the wavelength of each.
(frequency_a)(MHz:)
(frequency_b)(MHz:)

## A
and(frequency_b,(MHz). Calculate the wavelength of each.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency_a = randrange(850,950,10)
frequency_b = randrange(2500,2600,10)

E = ((3*10**8)/(frequency_a*10**6))*10**2
F = ((3*10**8)/(frequency_b*10**6))*10**2
