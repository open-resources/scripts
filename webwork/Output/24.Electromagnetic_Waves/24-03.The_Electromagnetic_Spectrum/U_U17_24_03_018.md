## Question Section 

a) What is the frequency of the(wavelength,(nm) ultraviolet radiation used in laser eye surgery?
 
b) Assuming the accuracy with which this EM radiation can ablate the cornea is directly proportional to wavelength, how much more accurate can this UV be than the shortest visible wavelength of light? (Which is(380)(nm)).

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength = randrange(190,195,1)

E = (3*10**8)/(wavelength*10**-9)
F = ((380/wavelength)-1)*10**2
