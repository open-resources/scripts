## Question Section 

<b>.
Two parallel conducting plates are separated by(distanceT)(cm), and one of them is taken to be at zero volts.
a) What is the electric field strength between them, if the potential(distancezero)(cm) from the zero volt plate (and(distancehigh)(cm) from the other) is(voltageSI)(V)? 
ans_rule(40)(kVm)

## A
What is the electric field strength between them, if the potential(distancezero)(cm) from the zero volt plate (and(distancehigh)(cm) from the other) is(voltageSI)(V)? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distanceT = randrange(9,11,1)
distanceTSI = distanceT/100
distancezero = randrange(6,8,1)
distancezeroSI = distancezero/100
distancehigh = distanceT-distancezero
distancehighSI = distancehigh/100
voltageSI = randrange(425,475,5)

EFieldSI = (voltageSI)/(distancezeroSI)
EFieldkVm = EFieldSI/1000

voltagehighSI = (EFieldSI)*(distanceTSI)
