## Question Section 

<b>
Find the maximum potential difference between two parallel conducting plates separated by(distance)(cm) of air, given the maximum sustainable electric field strength in air to be(EFieldbreak)(MVm).
ans_rule(40)(kV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.4,0.6,0.01))
distanceSI = distance/100
EFieldbreak = sprintf("%0.2f",3)
EFieldbreakSI = EFieldbreak*10**6

voltageSI = (distanceSI)*(EFieldbreakSI)
voltagekV = voltageSI/1000
