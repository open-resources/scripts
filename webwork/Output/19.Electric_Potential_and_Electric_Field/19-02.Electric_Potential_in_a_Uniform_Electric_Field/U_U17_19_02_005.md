## Question Section 

<b>
How far away can two parallel conducting plates be from each other and still have the electric field strength between them exceed the break down strength for air(EFieldbreak)(MVm) if a potential difference of(voltagetimes 10^3)(V) is applied?
ans_rule(40)(mm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
EFieldbreak = sprintf("%0.2f",3)
EFieldbreakSI = EFieldbreak*10**6
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(4.5,9.5,0.5))
voltageSI = voltage*1000

distanceSI = (voltageSI)/(EFieldbreakSI)
distancemm = distanceSI*1000
