## Question Section 

<b>
An electron is to be accelerated in a uniform electric field having a strength of(EFieldtimes 10^6)(Vm).
a) What energy in(keV) is given to the electron if it is accelerated through(distanceASI)(m)?
ans_rule(40)(keV)

## A
What energy in(keV) is given to the electron if it is accelerated through(distanceASI)(m)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
EField = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.9,2.1,0.01))
EFieldSI = EField*10**6 
distanceASI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.35,0.45,0.01))

energyASI = (Qelem*distanceASI*EFieldSI)
energyAkeV = ((energyASI)/(Qelem))/1000

energyBGeV = randrange(48,60,1)
energyBSI = (energyBGeV*10**9*Qelem)
distanceBSI = ((energyBSI)/(Qelem*EFieldSI))
distanceBkm = distanceBSI/1000
