## Question Section 

<b>
A doubly charged ion is accelerated to an energy of(energy)(keV) by the electric field between two parallel conducting plates separated by(distance)(cm). What is the electric field strength between the plates?
ans_rule(40)(Vm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
charge = 2*Qelem
energy = randrange(31.8,32.8,0.4)
energySI = (energy*Qelem)*1000
distance = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.8,2.2,0.01))
distanceSI = distance/100

EFieldSI = ((energySI)/(charge*distanceSI))
