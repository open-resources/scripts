## Question Section 

<b>
Membrane walls of living cells have surprisingly large electric fields across them due to separation of ions. What is the voltage across an(distance)(nm)â€“thick membrane if the electric field strength across it is(EField)(MVm)? You may assume a uniform electric field.
ans_rule(40)(mV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
EField = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(5.25,5.75,0.25))
EFieldSI = EField*10**6
distance = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(7.50,8.50,0.25))
distanceSI = distance/(10**9)

voltageSI = (EFieldSI)*(distanceSI)
voltagemV = voltageSI*1000
