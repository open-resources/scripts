## Question Section 

<b>
The voltage across a membrane forming a cell wall is(voltage)(mV) and the membrane is(distance)(nm) thick. What is the electric field strength? You may assume a uniform electric field.
ans_rule(40)(Vm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(75,85,5))
voltageSI = voltage/1000
distance = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(8.50,9.50,0.25))
distanceSI = distance/(10**9)

EFieldSI = (voltageSI)/(distanceSI)
