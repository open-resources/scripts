## Question Section 

<b>
A nervous physicist worries that the two metal shelves of his wood frame bookcase might obtain a high voltage if charged by static electricity, perhaps produced by friction.
a) What is the capacitance of the empty shelves if they have area(areaSI)(m^2) and are(distanceSI)(m) apart?
ans_rule(40)(F)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
permittivity = 8.85*10**-12
areaSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
distanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.190,0.210,0.001))
charge = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(1.5,5,0.5))
chargeSI = charge*10**-9

capacitanceSI = ((permittivity*areaSI)/(distanceSI))
voltageSI = (chargeSI)/(capacitanceSI)
energySI = (0.5*capacitanceSI*(voltageSI**2))
