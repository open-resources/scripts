## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> On a particular day, it takes(energytimes 10^3)(J) of electric energy to start a truck's engine. Calculate the capacitance of a capacitor that could store that amount of energy at(voltageSI)(V).
ans_rule(40)(F)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(9.5,9.9,0.05)
energySI = energy*10**3
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.1f", 12)

capacitanceSI = ((2*energySI)/(voltageSI**2))
