## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A battery-operated car utilizes a(voltage)(V) system. Find the charge the batteries must be able to move in order to accelerate the(mass)(kg) car from rest to(velocityacc)(ms), make it climb a(height)(times 10^2)(m) high hill, and then cause it to travel at a constant(velocityconst)(ms) by exerting a(forcetimes 10^2)(N) force for an hour.
ans_rule(40)(C)

## G
car from rest to(velocityacc)(ms), make it climb a(height)(times 10^2)(m) high hill, and then cause it to travel at a constant(velocityconst)(ms) by exerting a(forcetimes 10^2)(N) force for an hour.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
g = 9.8
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f",12)
mass = randrange(725,775,25)
velocityacc = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(20,25,2.5))
velocityconst = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(20,25,2.5))
height = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(1.5,2.5,0.5))
heightm = height*100
force = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(4.75,5.25,0.25))
forceN = force*100

powerconst = (forceN)*(velocityconst)
energy = (0.5*mass*(velocityacc)**2+mass*g*heightm+powerconst*3600)
charge = (energy)/(voltage)
