## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> What is the average power output of a heart defibrillator that dissipates(energy)(J) of energy in(time)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(390,410,1)
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(8,10.5,0.1))
power = energy/(time*10**-3)
