### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(12,24,12)
massglass = randrange(40,60,2)
massglasskg = massglass/1000
masswater = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(2.40,2.60,0.05))
masswaterkg = masswater/10
massalu = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.95,2.05,0.05))
massalukg = massalu/10
heatcapglass = 840
heatcapwater = 4186
heatcapalu = 900
temp1 = randrange(15,20,1)
temp2 = randrange(85,90,1)
timemin = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(4.5,5.5,0.5))
times = timemin*60
e = 1.6*10**-19

deltatemp = temp2-temp1
energy = deltatemp*((massglasskg*heatcapglass)+(masswaterkg*heatcapwater)+
                                          (massalukg*heatcapalu))

charge = (energy)/(voltage)
current = (charge)/(times)
electrons = (current)/(e)
