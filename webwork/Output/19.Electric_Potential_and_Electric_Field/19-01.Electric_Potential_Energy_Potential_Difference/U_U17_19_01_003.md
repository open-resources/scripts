## Question Section 

<b>
A bare helium nucleus has two positive charges and a mass of(mass)(times 10^-27)(kg).
a) Calculate its kinetic energy in joules at(percent)(%) of the speed of light.
ans_rule(40)(J)

## A
Calculate its kinetic energy in joules at(percent)(%) of the speed of light.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = 6.64
c = 3.00*10**8
percent = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.9,2.1,0.1))
e = 1.602

velocity = ((percent/100)*c)
energy = 0.5*(mass*10**-27)*(velocity)**2
energyeV = energy/(e*10**-19)
voltage = energy/(2*(e*10**-19))
