## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> Singly charged ions are accelerated from rest through a voltage of(voltage)(V). At what temperature will the average kinetic energy of gas molecules be the same as that given by these ions?
ans_rule(40)(K)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(12,20,0.1))
Kb = 1.38*10**-23
charge = 1.6*10**-19

temp = (2*charge*voltage)/(3*Kb)
