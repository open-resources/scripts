## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Find the voltage near a(diameter)(cm) diameter metal sphere that has(charge)(C) of excess positive charge on it.
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(9,20,0.1))
radiusm = diameter/200
charge = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(7.5,8.5,0.1))
K = 9*10**9

voltage = ((K)*(charge))/(radiusm)
