## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> Fusion probability is greatly enhanced when appropriate nuclei are brought close together, but mutual Coulomb repulsion must be overcome. This can be done using the kinetic energy of high-temperature gas ions or by accelerating the nuclei toward one another.
a) Calculate the potential energy of two singly charged nuclei separated by(distancetimes 10^-12)(m).
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
Calculate the potential energy of two singly charged nuclei separated by(distancetimes 10^-12)(m).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,1.2,0.01))
distancem = distance*10**-12
k = 9*10**9
Kb = 1.38*10**-23
charge = 1.6*10**-19

energy = (k*(charge)**2)/(distancem)
temp = (2*energy)/(3*Kb)
