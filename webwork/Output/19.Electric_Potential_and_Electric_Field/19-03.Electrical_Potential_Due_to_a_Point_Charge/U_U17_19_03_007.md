## A
What is the potential(radius)(times 10^-14)(m) from a fragment that has(nprotons) protons in it?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
radius = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
radiusSI = radius*10**-14
nprotons = randrange(44,48,1)
chargeSI = (Qelem*nprotons)

voltageSI = (K*chargeSI)/(radiusSI)
energySI = (voltageSI)*(chargeSI)
energyeV = (energySI)/(Qelem)
energyMeV = (energyeV)/(10**6)
