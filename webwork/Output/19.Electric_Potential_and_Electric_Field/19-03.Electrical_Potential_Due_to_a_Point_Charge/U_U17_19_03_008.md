### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
diameterSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
radiusSI = diameterSI/2
charge = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.75,5.25,0.25))
chargeSI = charge/1000 
voltageB = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
voltageBSI = voltageB*10**6

voltagesurfaceSI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(radiusSI)

voltagesurfaceMV = voltagesurfaceSI/(10**6)
radiusBSI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(voltageBSI)

energyCSI = ((K)*(chargeSI)*(3*Qelem))/(radiusSI)
energyCeV = (energyCSI)/(Qelem)
energyMeV = (energyCeV)/(10**6)
