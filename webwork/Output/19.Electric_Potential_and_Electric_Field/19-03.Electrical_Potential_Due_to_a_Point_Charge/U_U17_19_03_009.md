## Question Section 

<b>
An electrostatic paint sprayer has a(diameterSI)-(m)-diameter metal sphere at a potential of(voltage)(kV) that repels paint droplets onto a grounded object.
a) What charge is on the sphere?
ans_rule(40)(C)

## A
What charge is on the sphere?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
diameterSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.195,0.205,0.005))
radiusSI = diameterSI/2
voltage = randrange(24,28,1)
voltageSI = voltage*1000
mass = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.09,0.11,0.005))
massSI = mass/(10**6)
velocitySI = randrange(10,20,1)

chargesphereSI = ((voltageSI)*(radiusSI))/(K)
chargedropSI = (0.5*massSI*(velocitySI)**2)/(voltageSI)
