## Question Section 

<b>
In one of the classic nuclear physics experiments at the beginning of the 20th century, an alpha particle was accelerated toward a gold nucleus, and its path was substantially deflected by the Coulomb interaction. If the energy of the doubly charged alpha nucleus was(KEMeV)(MeV), how close to the gold nucleus could it come before being deflected? (For reference, the size of a gold nucleus is about(7)(fm).)
ans_rule(40)(fm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
Qelem = 1.6*10**-19
KEMeV = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,6,0.1))
KEeV = KEMeV*(10**6)
KESI = (KEeV*Qelem)
chargegoldSI = 79*Qelem
chargealphaSI = 2*Qelem

radiusSI = (K*chargealphaSI*chargegoldSI)/(KESI)
radiusfm = radiusSI*10**15
