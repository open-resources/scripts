## Question Section 

<b>
What is the difference in potential between two points situated(distanceclose)(cm) and(distancefar)(cm) from a(chargetimes 10^-6)(C) point charge?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
distanceclose = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,12,0.1))
distancecloseSI = distanceclose/100
distancefar = 2*distanceclose
distancefarSI = 2*distancecloseSI
charge = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(2,6,1))
chargeSI = charge*10**-6

voltagedropSI = (K*chargeSI)*((1/distancecloseSI)-(1/distancefarSI))
