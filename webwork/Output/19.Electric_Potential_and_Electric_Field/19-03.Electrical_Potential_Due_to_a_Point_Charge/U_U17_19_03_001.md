## Question Section 

<b>
A(diameter)(cm) diameter plastic sphere, used in a static electricity demonstration, has a uniformly distributed(charge)(pC) charge on its surface. What is the potential near its surface?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
K = 9*10**9
diameter = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.475,0.525,0.025))
radiusSI = diameter/200
charge = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(38,42,0.5))
chargeSI = charge*10**-12

voltageSI = ((K)*(chargeSI))/(radiusSI)
