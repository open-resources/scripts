### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Kdielectric = 6.7
permittivity = 8.85*10**-12
areaSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.25,2.5,0.25))
distance = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.0190,0.0210,0.0010))
distanceSI = distance*10**-3
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(10,20,0.5))

capacitanceSI = (Kdielectric*permittivity*areaSI)/(distanceSI)
capacitanceuF = capacitanceSI*10**6

chargeSI = (capacitanceSI*voltageSI)
