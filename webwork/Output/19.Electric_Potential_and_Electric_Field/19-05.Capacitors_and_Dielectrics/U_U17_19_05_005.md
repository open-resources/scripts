## Question Section 

<b>
What voltage must be applied to an(capacitance)(nF) capacitor to store(charge)(mC) of charge?
ans_rule(40)(kV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,10,0.25))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-9
charge = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.15,0.3,0.01))
chargeSI = charge*10**-3

voltageSI = (chargeSI)/(capacitanceSI)
voltagekV = voltageSI*10**-3
