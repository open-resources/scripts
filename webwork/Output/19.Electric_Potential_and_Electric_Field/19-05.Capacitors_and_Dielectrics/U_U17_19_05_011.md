## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A certain parallel plate capacitor has plates of area(areaSI)(m^2), separated by(distance)(mm) of nylon, and stores(chargeSI)(C) of charge. 
a) What is the applied voltage?
ans_rule(40)(kV)

## A
What is the applied voltage?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Kdielectric = 3.4
permittivity = 8.85*10**-12
areaSI = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(3.75,6,0.25))
distance = sprintf("%0.4f",randrange(0.0090,0.0180,0.0010))
distanceSI = distance*10**-3
chargeSI = sprintf("%0.3f",randrange(0.160,0.320,0.010))

capacitanceSI = (Kdielectric*permittivity*areaSI)/(distanceSI)
voltageSI = (chargeSI)/(capacitanceSI)
voltagekV = voltageSI*10**-3
