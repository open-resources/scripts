## Question Section 

A galaxy moving away from the earth has a speed of(speed,(c). What wavelength do we observe for an(n)<sub>i<sub> =(ni) to(n)<sub>f<sub> =(nf) transition for hydrogen in that galaxy?

## F
transition for hydrogen in that galaxy?
### Answer Section
## I
to(n)<sub>f<sub> =(nf) transition for hydrogen in that galaxy?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(0.0090,0.0110,0.0001)
ni = randrange(5,7,1)
nf = randrange(2,4,1)

E = (((1/(1.097*10**7))*(((nf*ni)**2)/(ni**2-nf**2)))*10**9)*((1+speed)/(1-speed))**(1/2)
