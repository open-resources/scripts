## Question Section 

Calculate the minimum amount of energy in joules needed to create a population inversion in a helium-neon laser containing(moles)(times 10^-4) moles of neon.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
moles = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

E = ((moles*10**-4)*(6.02*10**23)*20.66)*(1.6*10**-19)
