## Question Section 

A pulsar is a rapidly spinning remnant of a supernova. It rotates on its axis, sweeping hydrogen along with it so that hydrogen on one side moves toward us as fast as(speed,(kms), while that on the other side moves away as fast as(speed,(kms). This means that the EM radiation we receive will be Doppler shifted over a range of(pm speed,(kms) . What range of wavelengths will we observe for the(91.20,(nm) line in the Lyman series of hydrogen? (Such line broadening is observed and actually provides part of the evidence for rapid rotation.)
The range is from (toward) to (away)

## D
to (away)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(40,60,1)

E = 91.2*((1-((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8)))/(1+((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8))))**(1/2)
F = 91.2*((1+((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8)))/(1-((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8))))**(1/2)
