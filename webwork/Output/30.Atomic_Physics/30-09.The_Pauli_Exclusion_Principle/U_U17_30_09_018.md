## Question Section 

A carbon dioxide laser used in surgery emits infrared radiation with a wavelength of(wavelength)(mu(m). In(time,(ms), this laser raised the temperature of(area)(cm^3) of flesh to(100^circ)(C) and evaporated it (assume body temperature is(37^circ(C)).
a) How many photons were required? You may assume flesh has the same heat of vaporization as water.
ans_rule(40) photons
b) What was the minimum power output during the flash?

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength = randrange(10,11,0.1)
time = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
area = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)

mass = 1000*(area)*(1/100)**3
energy = mass*(4186*(100-37)+(2.256*10**6))
energy_y = ((6.63*10**-34)*(3*10**8))/(wavelength*10**-6)

E = (energy/energy_y)
F = (energy/(time*10**-3))*10**-6
