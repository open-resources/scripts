## Question Section 

A neighboring galaxy rotates on its axis so that stars on one side move toward us as fast as(speed,(kms), while those on the other side move away as fast as(speed,(kms). This causes the EM radiation we receive to be Doppler shifted by velocities over the entire range of(pm speed,(kms). What range of wavelengths will we observe for the(656.0,(nm) line in the Balmer series of hydrogen emitted by stars in this galaxy. (This is called line broadening.)
The range is from (toward) to (away)

## D
to (away)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(175,225,1)

E = 656*((1-((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8)))/(1+((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8))))**(1/2)
F = 656*((1+((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8)))/(1-((speed*10**3)/(3*10**8))))**(1/2)
