## Question Section 

What voltage must be applied to an X-ray tube to obtain(wavelength,(fm) wavelength X-rays for use in exploring the details of nuclei?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength = randrange(0.0095,0.0105,0.0001)

E = ((6.63*10**-34)*(3*10**8))/((1.6*10**-19)*(wavelength*10**-15))
