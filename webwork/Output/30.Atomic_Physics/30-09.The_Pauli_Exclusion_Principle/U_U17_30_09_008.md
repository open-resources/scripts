## Question Section 

Estimate the density of a nucleus by calculating the density of a proton, taking it to be a sphere(diameter,(fm) in diameter.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(1,1.4,0.1)
radius = (diameter*10**-15)/2

V = (4/3)*pi*radius**3

E = ((1.67*10**-27)/V)*1000/100**3
