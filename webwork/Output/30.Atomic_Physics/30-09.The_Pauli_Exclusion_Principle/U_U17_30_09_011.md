## Question Section 

Calculate the velocity of a star moving relative to the earth if you observe a wavelength of(91.0,(nm) for ionized hydrogen capturing an electron directly into the lowest orbital (that is, a(n_i =infty) to(n_f = 1), or a Lyman series transition).



## Answer Section

E = -6.58*10**5
