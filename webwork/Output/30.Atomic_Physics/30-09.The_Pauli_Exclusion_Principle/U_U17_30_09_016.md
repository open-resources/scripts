## Question Section 

Particles called muons exist in cosmic rays and can be created in particle accelerators. Muons are very similar to electrons, having the same charge and spin, but they have a mass(207) times greater. When muons are captured by anatom, they orbit just like an electron but with a smaller radius, since the mass in(a_B=frach^24pi^2m_ekq_e^2=0.529times 10^-10)(m) is(207 m_e).
Calculate the radius of the(n = 1) orbit for a muon in a uranium ion((Z = 92)).



## Answer Section

E = 2.78
