## Question Section 

In a Millikan oil-drop experiment, a(voltage,(V) potential difference is applied to plates separated by(distance,(cm).
a) What is the mass of an oil drop having two extra electrons that is suspended motionless by the field between the plates?
b) What is the diameter of the drop, assuming it is a sphere with the density of olive oil?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(475,525,5)
distance = randrange(2,3,0.1)

E = ((2*(1.602*10**-19)*voltage)/((distance*10**-2)*9.8))*10**16
F = ((3*(E*10**-16))/(4*pi*(9.2*10**2)))**(1/3)
