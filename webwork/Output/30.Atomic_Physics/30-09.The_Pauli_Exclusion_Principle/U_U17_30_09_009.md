b) At what angle will the fourth line of the Balmer series appear in first order?
ans_rule(40) °
c) At what angle will the second-order maximum be for the first line?
ans_rule(40) °

## A
What is the distance between the slits of a diffraction grating that produces a first-order maximum for the first Balmer line at an angle of(angle^circ)?
### Answer Section
## B
At what angle will the fourth line of the Balmer series appear in first order?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
angle = randrange(15,20,1)
wavelength = 6.563*10**-7
wavelength_balmer = 4.102*10**-7


E = wavelength/sin(angle*pi/180)
F = (asin(wavelength_balmer/E))*180/pi
G = ((asin((2*wavelength)/E)))*180/pi
