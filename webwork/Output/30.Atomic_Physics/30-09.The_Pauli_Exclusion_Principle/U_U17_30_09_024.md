## Question Section 

A student in a physics laboratory observes a hydrogen spectrum with a diffraction grating for the purpose of measuring the wavelengths of the emitted radiation. In the spectrum, she observes a yellow line and finds its wavelength to be(wavelength,(nm).
Assuming this is part of the Balmer series, determine(n)<sub>i<sub>, the principal quantum number of the initial state.
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
wavelength = randrange(580,590,1)

E = (((wavelength*10**-9)*(1.097*10**7)*4)/(((wavelength*10**-9)*(1.097*10**7))-4))**(1/2)
