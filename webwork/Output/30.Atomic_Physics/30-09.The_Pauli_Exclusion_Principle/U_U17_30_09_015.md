## Question Section 

Find the value of(l), the orbital angular momentum quantum number, for the moon around the earth. The extremely large value obtained implies that it is impossible to tell the difference between adjacent quantized orbits for macroscopic objects.



## Answer Section

E = (4*pi**2*7.35*10**22*(3.84*10**8)**2)/((2.36*10**6)*6.63*(10**(-34)))*10**(-68)
