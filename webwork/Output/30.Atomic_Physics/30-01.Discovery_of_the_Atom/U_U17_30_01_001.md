## Question Section 

Using the given charge-to-mass ratios for electrons((electron)(times 10^11,(Ckg)) and protons((proton)(times 10^7,(Ckg)), and knowing the magnitudes of their charges are equal, what is the ratio of the proton's mass to the electron's?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
electron = randrange(1.7,1.8,0.01)
proton = randrange(9.5,9.6,0.01)

E = (electron*10**11)/(proton*10**7)
