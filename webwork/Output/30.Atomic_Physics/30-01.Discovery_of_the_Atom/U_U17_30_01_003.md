## Question Section 

If someone wanted to build a scale model of the atom with a nucleus(diameter,(m) in diameter, how far away would the nearest electron need to be?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(1,1.5,0.1)

E = (((diameter/2)*(10**-10))/(10**-15))*10**-3
