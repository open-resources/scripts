## Question Section 

An aspiring physicist wants to build a scale model of a hydrogen atom for her science fair project. If the atom is(diameter,(m) in diameter, how big should she try to make the nucleus?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
diameter = randrange(0.5,1.5,0.25)

E = (((10**-15)/(10**-10))*diameter)*10**6
