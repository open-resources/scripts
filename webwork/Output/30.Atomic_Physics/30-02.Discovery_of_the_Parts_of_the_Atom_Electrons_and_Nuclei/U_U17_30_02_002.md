## Question Section 

In Millikan's oil-drop experiment, one looks at a small oil drop held motionless between two plates. Take the voltage between the plates to be(voltage,(V), and the plate separation to be(separation,(cm). The oil drop (of density(density,(gcm^3)) has a diameter of(diameter)(times 10^-6,(m). Find the charge on the drop, in terms of electron units.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(2000,2100,1)
separation = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
density = randrange(0.8,0.85,0.01)
diameter = randrange(3.5,4.5,0.1)

E = (((((density*10**3)*pi*(diameter*10**-6)**3)/6)*9.8*(separation*10**-2))/voltage)*10**18
