## Question Section 

A color television tube also generates some x rays when its electron beam strikes the screen. What is the shortest wavelength of these x rays, if a(voltage,(kV) potential is used to accelerate the electrons? (Note that TVs have shielding to prevent these x rays from exposing viewers.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(25,35,0.5)

E = (((6.626*10**-34)*(2.998*10**8))/((1.602*10**-19)*(voltage*10**3)))*10**11
