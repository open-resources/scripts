What is the most energetic x-ray photon it can produce? Express your answer in electron volts.
### Answer Section
## B
Find the wavelength of such an X–ray.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(80,110,1)

E = (voltage*10**3)
F = (((6.63*10**-34)*(3*10**8))/(E/(6.242*10**18)))*10**11
