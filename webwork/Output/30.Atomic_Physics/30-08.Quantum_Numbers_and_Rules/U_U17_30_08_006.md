## A
What is the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum for an(l) =(l) electron?
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate the magnitude of the electron's spin angular momentum.
### Answer Section
## C
What is the ratio of these angular momenta?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
l = randrange(1,3,1)

E = (((l*(l+1))**(1/2))*((6.63)/(2*pi)))
F = (((3/4)**(1/2))*((6.626)/(2*pi)))
G = E/F
