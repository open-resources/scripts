## Question Section 

A hydrogen atom in an excited state can be ionized with less energy than when it is in its ground state. What is n for a hydrogen atom if(energy,(eV) of energy can ionize it?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(0.544,0.850,0.306)

E = (13.6/energy)**(1/2)
