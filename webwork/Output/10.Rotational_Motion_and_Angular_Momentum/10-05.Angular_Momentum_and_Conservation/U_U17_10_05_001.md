a) Calculate the angular momentum of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. 
(s)
b) Compare this angular momentum with the angular momentum of Earth on its axis.
(s)

## A
Calculate the angular momentum of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. 
### Answer Section
## B
Compare this angular momentum with the angular momentum of Earth on its axis.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Mass = 5.979*(10**24)
Radiusa = (1.496*(10**11))**2
Radiusb = (6.376*(10**6))**2
velocity = (2*pi)/(3.16*(10**7))
angularmomentum = Mass*Radiusa*velocity
Lorb = (2/5)*Mass*Radiusb*((2*pi)/(24*3600))
