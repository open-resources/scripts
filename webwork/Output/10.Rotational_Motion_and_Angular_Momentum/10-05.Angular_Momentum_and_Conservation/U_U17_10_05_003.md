## Question Section 

Suppose you start an antique car by exerting a force of(Force) N on its crank for(time) s. What angular momentum is given to the engine if the handle of the crank is(radius) m from the pivot and the force is exerted to create maximum torque the entire time?
(s)

## E
N on its crank for(tims. What angular momentum is given to the engine if the handle of the crank is(radius) m from the pivot and the force is exerted to create maximum torque the entire time?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Force = randrange(300,400,1)
radius = randrange(0.3,0.4,0.001)
time = randrange(0.23,0.28,0.001)
angularmomentum = radius*Force*time
