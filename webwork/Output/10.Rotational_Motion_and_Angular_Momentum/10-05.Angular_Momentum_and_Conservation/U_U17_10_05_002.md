## Question Section 

a) What is the angular momentum of the Moon in its orbit around Earth? 
(s)

b) How does this angular momentum compare with the angular momentum of the Moon on its axis? Remember that the Moon keeps one side toward Earth at all times.

## B
How does this angular momentum compare with the angular momentum of the Moon on its axis? Remember that the Moon keeps one side toward Earth at all times.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Mass = 7.35*(10**22)
Radiusa = (3.84*(10**8))**2
Radiusb = (1.74*(10**6))**2
velocity = (2*pi)/(2.36*(10**6))
angularmomentuma = Mass*Radiusa*velocity
angularmomentumb = (2/5)*Mass*Radiusb*velocity
