## Question Section 

Three children are riding on the edge of a merry-go-round that is(Mass) kg, has a(radius)- m radius, and is spinning at(angularvelocity) rpm. The children have masses of(mass1),(mass2), and(mass3) kg. If the child who has a mass of(mass2) kg moves to the centre of the merry-go- round, what is the new angular velocity in rpm?
ans_rule(40) rpm



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Mass = randrange(100,120,1)
mass1 = randrange(20,23,1)
mass2 = randrange(26,29,1)
mass3 = randrange(33,36,1)
radius = randrange(1.3,1.9,0.01)
angularvelocity = randrange(20,30,1)
angularmomentum = ((Mass/2)+mass1+mass2+mass3)/((Mass/2)+mass1+mass3)*angularvelocity
