## Question Section 

What is the moment of inertia of an object that rolls without slipping down a(height)-m- high incline starting from rest, and has a final velocity of(velocity) ms? Express the moment of inertia as a multiple of(MR^2), where(M) is the mass of the object and(R) is its radius.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

height = randrange(2,4,0.1)
velocity = randrange(6,8,0.1)
gravity = 9.8
Inertia = 2*(((gravity*height)-(0.5*(velocity**2)))/(velocity**2))
