## Question Section 

A ball with an initial velocity of(initialvelocity) ms rolls up a hill without slipping. Treating the ball as a spherical shell, calculate the vertical height it reaches. 
ans_rule(40) m
b) Repeat the calculation for the same ball if it slides up the hill without rolling.
ans_rule(40) m

## B
Repeat the calculation for the same ball if it slides up the hill without rolling.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

initialvelocity = randrange(6,9,0.1)
gravity = 9.8
heighta = (1/3)*((initialvelocity**2)/gravity)
heightb = ((initialvelocity**2)/(2*gravity))
