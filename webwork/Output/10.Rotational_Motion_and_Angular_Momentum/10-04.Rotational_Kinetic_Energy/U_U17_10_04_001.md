## Question Section 

![merry-go-round.]("NU_U17_10_04_001.png")

An child jumps on 0.25 m from the edge of the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a 1.50 m radius.
a) Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the merry-go-round plus child when they have an angular velocity of(angularvelocityrpm) rpm if the system's inertia is 84.38 Nm. 
ans_rule(40) J

## A
Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the merry-go-round plus child when they have an angular velocity of(angularvelocityrpm) rpm if the system's inertia is 84.38 Nm. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

angularvelocityrpm = 20
angularvelocity = angularvelocityrpm*((2*pi)/60)
Inertia = 84.38
KineticEnergy = 0.5*Inertia*(angularvelocity**2)
Torque = 375
radius = 1.5
angularvelocityrest = (KineticEnergy/Torque)*(1/(2*pi))
Force = KineticEnergy/(radius*4*pi)
