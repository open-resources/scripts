## Question Section 

A bus contains a(massfly) kg flywheel (a disk that has a(radius) m radius) and has a total mass of(Massbus) kg. 
a) Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have to contain enough energy to take the bus from rest to a speed of(velocitya) ms, assuming(90.0)% of the rotational kinetic energy can be transformed into translational energy. 
ans_rule(40) rads
b) How high a hill can the bus climb with this stored energy and still have a speed of(velocityb) ms at the top of the hill?
ans_rule(40) m

## A
Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have to contain enough energy to take the bus from rest to a speed of(velocityms, assuming(90.0)% of the rotational kinetic energy can be transformed into translational energy.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

massfly = randrange(1420,1640,1)
Massbus = randrange(10000,13000,1)
radius = randrange(0.5,0.69,0.001)
velocitya = randrange(20,30,1)
velocityb = randrange(2,5,1)
gravity = 9.8
angularvelocity = sqrt((2*Massbus*(velocitya**2))/(0.9*massfly*(radius**2)))
height = ((0.9*massfly*(radius**2)*(angularvelocity**2))-(2*Massbus*(velocityb**2)))/(4*gravity*Massbus)
