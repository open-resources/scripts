## Question Section 

While exercising in a fitness centre, a man lies face down on a bench and lifts a weight with one lower leg by contracting the muscles in the back of the upper leg. 
a) Find the angular acceleration produced given the mass lifted is(mass) kg at a distance of(radius) cm from the knee joint, the moment of inertia of the lower leg is(Inertia)(kg m^2) , the muscle force is(Force) N, and its effective perpendicular lever arm is(Radius) cm. 
ans_rule(40)(rads^2)
