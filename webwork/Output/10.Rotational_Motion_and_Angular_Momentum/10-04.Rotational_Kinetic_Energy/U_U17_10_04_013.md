## Question Section 

Suppose a(mass)-kg motorcycle has two wheels of mass 12.0-kg with an
inner radius of 0.280 m and an outer radius of 0.330 m that behave like annular rings. It is heading toward a hill at a speed of(velocity) ms. 
a) How high can it coast up the hill, if you neglect friction? 
ans_rule(40) m
b) How much energy is lost to friction if the motorcycle only gains an altitude of(heighto) m before coming to rest?
ans_rule(40) J

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

heighto = randrange(32,36,1)
velocity = randrange(30,38,1)
mass = randrange(200,280,1)
gravity = 9.8
Mass = 100
Radius = 0.330
Inertia = 1.1238
heightf = ((velocity**2)/(mass*gravity))*(mass/2+(Inertia/(Radius**2)))
Energy = mass*gravity*(heightf-heighto)
