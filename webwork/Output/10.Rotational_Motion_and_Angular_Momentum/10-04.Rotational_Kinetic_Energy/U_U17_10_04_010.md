## Question Section 

To develop muscle tone, a woman lifts a(mass)-kg weight held in her hand. She uses her biceps muscle to flex the lower arm through an angle of(degree ^circ). 
a) What is the angular acceleration if the weight is(radiusw) cm from the elbow joint, her forearm has a moment of inertia of(Inertia)(kg m^2), and the muscle force is(Force) N at an effective perpendicular lever arm of(radius) cm? 
b) How much work does she do?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

degree = randrange(57,69,1)
theta = degree*((2*pi)/360)
Inertia = randrange(0.23,0.28,0.001)
Force = randrange(700,800,1)
gravity = 9.8
mass = randrange(2,5,1)
radiusw = randrange(23,26,0.1)
radius = randrange(2,3,0.1)
RF = (Radius/100)*Force
rmg = (radius/100)*mass*gravity
mr = ((radius/100)**2)*mass
angularacceleration = (Force*(radius/100))/(Inertia+(mass*((radiusw/100)**2)))
Work = Force*(radius/100)*theta
