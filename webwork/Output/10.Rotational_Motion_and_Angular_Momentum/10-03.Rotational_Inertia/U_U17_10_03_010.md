## Question Section 

Unreasonable Results A gymnast doing a forward flip lands on the mat and exerts a
(Torque)-NÂ·m torque to slow and then reverse her angular velocity. Her initial angular
velocity is(velocity) rads, and her moment of inertia is(Inertiakg m^2). 
a) What time is required for her to exactly reverse her spin? 
ans_rule(40) s

## A
What time is required for her to exactly reverse her spin? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Torque = randrange(500,600,1)
Inertia = randrange(0.04,0.06,0.001)
velocity = randrange(10,20,1)
angularacceleration = -Torque/Inertia
time = -velocity/angularacceleration
