## Question Section 

Suppose you exert a force of(Force) N tangential to a(radius)-m-radius(mass)-kg grindstone (a solid disk). 
a) What torque is exerted? 
ans_rule(40) N m
 
b) What is the angular acceleration assuming negligible opposing friction? 
 
c) What is the angular acceleration if there is an opposing frictional force of(ForceC) N exerted(radiusC) cm from the axis?
