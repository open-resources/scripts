## Question Section 

![Motorcycle wheel.]("NU_U17_10_03_006.png")

Consider the(mass) kg motorcycle wheel shown above. Assume it to be
approximately an annular ring with an inner radius of(innerradius) m and an outer radius of(outerradius) m. The motorcycle is on its centre stand, so that the wheel can spin freely. 
a) If the drive chain exerts a force of(Force) N at a radius of(radius) cm, what is the angular acceleration of the wheel? 
ans_rule(40) rads<sup>2<sup>
 
b) What is the tangential acceleration of a point on the outer edge of the tire?  
ans_rule(40) ms
 
c) How long, starting from rest, does it take to reach an angular velocity of(angularvelocity) rads?
ans_rule(40) s

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Force = 2200
mass = 12
radius = 5
innerradius = 0.28
outerradius = 0.33
ForceC = randrange(20,30,1)
angularvelocity = 80
Torque = (radius/100)*Force
Inertia = 0.5*mass*((outerradius**2)+(innerradius**2))
angularacceleration = Torque/Inertia
tangentialacceleration = angularacceleration*outerradius
time = angularvelocity/angularacceleration
