## Question Section 

Calculate the moment of inertia of a skater given the following information. 
a) The(massa)-kg skater is approximated as a cylinder that has a(radiusa)-m radius.
b) The skater with arms extended is approximately a cylinder that is(mass2) kg, has a(radiusa)-m radius, and has two(radius2)-m-long arms which are(mass3) kg each and extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated about their ends.

## A
The(massa)-kg skater is approximated as a cylinder that has a(radiusa)-m radius.
### Answer Section
## B
The skater with arms extended is approximately a cylinder that is(mass2) kg, has a(radiusa)-m radius, and has two(radius2)-m-long arms which are(mass3) kg each and extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated about their ends.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

massa = randrange(60,70,1)
radiusa = randrange(0.1,0.15,0.001)
radius2 = randrange(0.9,0.999,0.001)
mass2 = randrange(50,55,0.1)
mass3 = randrange(2,4,0.01)
Ia = (massa*(radiusa**2))/2
I1 = (mass2*(radiusa**2))/2
I2 = (mass3*(radius2**2))*(2/3)
I = I1+I2
