## Question Section 

An advertisement claims that an(masscar)-kg car is aided by its
(massfly)-kg flywheel, which can accelerate the car from rest to a speed of(velocity) ms. The flywheel is a disk with a(radius)-m radius. 
a) Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have if(95.0)% of its rotational energy is used to get the car up to speed.
ans_rule(40) revs
Is this reasonable?

## A
Calculate the angular velocity the flywheel must have if(95.0)% of its rotational energy is used to get the car up to speed.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

masscar = randrange(600,900,1)
massfly = randrange(14,26,1)
velocity = randrange(30,40,1)
radius = randrange(0.14,0.18,0.001)
angularvelocity =(((masscar*(velocity**2))/(0.95*0.5*massfly*(radius**2)))**(1/2))*(1/(2*pi))
