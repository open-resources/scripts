## Question Section 

A soccer player extends her lower leg in a kicking motion by exerting a force with the muscle above the knee in the front of her leg. She produces an angular acceleration of(angularacceleration)(rads^2) and her lower leg has a moment of inertia of(Inertia)(kg m^2). What is the force exerted by the muscle if its effective perpendicular lever arm is(radius) cm?
ans_rule(40) N
