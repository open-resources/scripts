## A
What is its angular acceleration in(rads^2)? 
### Answer Section
## B
How many revolutions does it go through in the process?
### Answer Section
## E
s. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

time = randrange(0.2,0.4,0.01)
angularvelocity = randrange(30,42,1)
angularacceleration = angularvelocity/time
theta = 0.5*(angularacceleration)*(time**2)*(1/(2*pi))
