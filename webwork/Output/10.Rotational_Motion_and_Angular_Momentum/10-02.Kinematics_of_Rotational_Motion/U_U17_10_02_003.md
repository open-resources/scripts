## Question Section 

A gyroscope slows from an initial rate of(velocity) rads at a rate of(angularaccelerationrads^2).
a) How long does it take to come to rest?
ans_rule(40) s
b) How many revolutions does it make before stopping?
ans_rule(40) rev

## A

### Answer Section
## B
How many revolutions does it make before stopping?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

angularacceleration = randrange(0.4,0.8,0.01)
velocity = randrange(30,42,1)
time = velocity/angularacceleration
theta = ((velocity*time)+(0.5*(angularacceleration)*(time**2)))*(1/(2*pi))
