## Question Section 

Everyday application: Suppose a yo-yo has a center shaft that has a(radius) cm radius
and that its string is being pulled. 
a) If the string is stationary and the yo-yo
accelerates away from it at a rate of(acceleration1ms^2), what is the angular acceleration of the yo-yo? 
ans_rule(40)(rads^2)
