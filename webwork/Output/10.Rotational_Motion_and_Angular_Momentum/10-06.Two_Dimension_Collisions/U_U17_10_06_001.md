## Question Section 

![Example 10.15]("NU_U17_10_06_001.png")

Suppose the disk in the figure above has a mass of 50.0 g and an initial velocity of 30.0 ms when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg. The disk adheres to the stick(radius) m from the nail.
a) What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision?
ans_rule(40) rads
b) What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?
ans_rule(40) J
c)What is the total linear momentum before and after the collision?
ans_rule(40) kg ms

## A
What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 0.05
velocity = 30
radius = 0.1
Inertia = 0.9605
angularvelocity = (mass*velocity*radius)/Inertia
KineticEnergy = 0.5*Inertia*(angularvelocity**2)
linearmomentum = ((mass*radius)+(1*1.2))*angularvelocity
