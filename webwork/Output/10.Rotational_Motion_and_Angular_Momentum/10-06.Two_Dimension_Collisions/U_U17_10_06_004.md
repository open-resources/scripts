## Question Section 

![Skater with Ball.]("NU_U17_10_06_004.png")

Suppose a(massball)-kg ball is thrown at(velocity) ms to a motionless person standing on ice who catches it with an outstretched arm as shown above. 
a) Calculate the final linear velocity of the person, given his mass is(MassPerson) kg. 
ans_rule(40) ms

## A
Calculate the final linear velocity of the person, given his mass is(MassPerson) kg. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

massball = 0.25
MassPerson = 70
velocity = 15
radius = 0.8
massarm = 5
length = 0.9
radiusb = 0.180
velocityb = 14.95
Inertia = 3.672
linearvelocity = (velocity*massball)/(massball+MassPerson)
angularvelocity = (massball*velocityb*length)/Inertia
KineticEnergy = (1/2)*(((massball+MassPerson)*(linearvelocity**2))+(Inertia*(angularvelocity**2)))
