## Question Section 

![10.15.]("NU_U17_10_06_001.png")

Suppose the disk pictured above has a mass of 50.0 g and an initial velocity of 30.0 ms when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg.
The nail is removed and the stick is free to have translational motion as well as rotational motion.
a) Calculate the angular momentum that is conserved in the CM frame.
ans_rule(40) rads
b) Calculate the final kinetic energy.
ans_rule(40) J
c) Calculate the linear momentum.
ans_rule(40) kg ms

## A

### Answer Section
## C
Calculate the linear momentum.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 0.05
Mass = 2
velocity = 30
radius = 1.2
velocityb = 0.7317
linearvelocity = 29.268
Inertia = 1.032
angularvelocity = (mass*linearvelocity*radius)/Inertia
KineticEnergy = (1/2)*(((mass+Mass)*(velocityb**2))+(Inertia*(angularvelocity**2)))
linearmomentum = mass*velocity
