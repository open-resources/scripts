## Question Section 

![Skaters.]("NU_U17_10_06_003.png")

Twin skaters approach one another as shown above and lock hands. 
a) Calculate their final angular velocity, given each had an initial speed of(velocity) ms relative to the ice. Each has a mass of(mass) kg, and each has a centre of mass located(radius) m from their locked hands. You may approximate their moments of inertia to be that of point masses at this radius. 
ans_rule(40) rads
b) Calculate the total kinetic energy of the system.
ans_rule(40) J

## A

### Answer Section
## B
Calculate the total kinetic energy of the system.

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 70
velocity = 2.5
radius = 0.8
angularvelocity = velocity/radius
KineticEnergy = mass*(velocity**2)
