## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Large meteors sometimes strike the Earth, converting most of
their kinetic energy into thermal energy. 
a) What is the kinetic energy of a(Mtimes 10^9)(kg) meteor moving at(vkm)(kms)? 
ans_rule(40)(J)

## A
What is the kinetic energy of a(Mtimes 10^9)(kg) meteor moving at(vkm)(kms)? 
### Answer Section
## G
meteor moving at(vkm)(kms)? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vkm = randrange(23,26,1)
v = (vkm*(10**3))**2
M = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1,2,0.01))
mmeteor = M*10**9
KE = (1/2)*mmeteor*v
T = randrange(5,8,1)
Q = 0.80*KE
c = 4186
m = Q/(c*T)
