## Question Section 

<b>
Radiation makes it impossible to stand close to a hot lava flow. Calculate the rate of
heat transfer by radiation from(A)(m^2) of(T1C ^circC) fresh lava into(T2C ^circC) surroundings, assuming lava's emissivity is(e).
ans_rule(40)(kW)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(1,2,1)
T1C = randrange(1200,1250,1)
T2C = randrange(30,39,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = sprintf("%0.2f",1)
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
P = (o*e*A*T)*(1/1000)
