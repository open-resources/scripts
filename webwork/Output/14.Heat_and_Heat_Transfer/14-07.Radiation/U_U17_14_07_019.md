## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Heat transfers from your lungs and breathing passages by
evaporating water. 
a) Calculate the maximum number of grams of water that can be evaporated when you inhale(1.50)(L) of(T ^circC) air with an original relative humidity of(40.0)(%). Assume that body temperature is also(T ^circC). 
ans_rule(40)(g)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

min = (1.5*(10**-3))*44*0.4
mex = (1.5*(10**-3))*44
m = mex-min
Lv = 2430
N = 10
t = 60
T = 37
Q = m*Lv
P = (N*Q)/t
