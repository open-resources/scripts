## Question Section 

<b>
Cherry-red embers in a fireplace are at(T1C ^circC) and have an exposed area of(A)(m^2) and an emissivity of(e). The surrounding room has a temperature of(T2C  ^circC). If(50)(%) of the radiant energy enters the room, what is the net rate of radiant heat transfer in kilowatts?
ans_rule(40)(kW)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(0.20,0.230,0.001)
T1C = randrange(830,850,1)
T2C = randrange(15,19,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = 0.980
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
P = (1/2)*(o*e*A*T)*(1/1000)
