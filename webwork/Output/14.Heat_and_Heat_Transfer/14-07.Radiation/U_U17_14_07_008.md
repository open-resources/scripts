## Question Section 

<b>
The Sun radiates like a perfect black body with an emissivity of exactly(e). 
a) Calculate the surface temperature of the Sun, given that it is a sphere with a(rsuntimes 10^8)(m) radius that radiates(Psuntimes 10^26)(W) into empty space having a temperature of(3.0)(K).
ans_rule(40)(K)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

e = sprintf("%0.2f",1)
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
rsun = 6.96
rsunc = (rsun*(10**8))**2
Asun = (2143/22)**(1/4)*4*rsunc
Psun= randrange(3.2,3.8,0.01)
Psunc = Psun*(10**26)
dtoearth = sprintf("%0.2f",1.50)
dtoearthc= (dtoearth*(10**11))**2
Asunatearth = pi*4*dtoearthc
T = (Psunc/(o*e*Asun))**(1/4)
PAb = Psunc/Asun
PAc = Psunc/Asunatearth
