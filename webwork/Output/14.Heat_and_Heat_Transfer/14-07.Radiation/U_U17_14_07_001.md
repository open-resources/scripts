## Question Section 

<b>
At what net rate does heat radiate from a(A)(m^2) black roof on a night when the roof's temperature is(T1C ^circC) and the surrounding temperature is(T2C  ^circC)? The emissivity of the roof is(e).
ans_rule(40)(kW)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(270,300,1)
T1C = randrange(30,35,1)
T2C = randrange(10,15,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = 0.900
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
P = o*e*A*T*(1/1000)
