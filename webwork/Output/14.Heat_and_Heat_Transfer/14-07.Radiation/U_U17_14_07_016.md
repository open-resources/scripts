## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Suppose you start a workout on a Stairmaster, producing power at the same rate as climbing(116) stairs per minute. Assuming your mass is(m)(kg) and your efficiency is(efficiency)(%), how long will it take for your body temperature to rise(T ^circC) if all other forms of heat transfer in and out of your body are balanced?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(73,77,1)
efficiency = randrange(20,23,1)
Pefficiency = efficiency/100
c = 3500
T = randrange(1,2,1)
Pgenerated = 685/Pefficiency
Pwasted = Pgenerated-685
t = (m*c*T)/Pwasted
