## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the rate of heat transfer by radiation from a car radiator at(T1C ^circC) into a(T2C ^circC) environment, if the radiator has an emissivity of(e) and a(A)(m^2) surface area.
ans_rule(40)(W)

## E
and a(A)(m^2) surface area.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint  = 3

A = randrange(1,1.32,0.01)
T1C = randrange(110,125,1)
T2C = randrange(50,59,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = 0.750
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
P = o*e*A*T
