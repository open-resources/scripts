## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Hot air rises because it has expanded. It then displaces a greater volume of cold air, which increases the buoyant force on it. 
a) Calculate the ratio of the buoyant force to the weight of(Th ^circC) air surrounded by(Tc ^circC) air. 
ans_rule(40)

## A
Calculate the ratio of the buoyant force to the weight of(Th ^circC) air surrounded by(Tc ^circC) air.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.8
h = 1
c = 721
p = 1.29
V = 1
Th = randrange(50,55,1)
ThK = Th+273.15
Tc = randrange(20,25,1)
TcK = Tc+273.15
T = Th-Tc
Thc = ThK/TcK
Q = p*V*c*T
PE = p*V*g*h
