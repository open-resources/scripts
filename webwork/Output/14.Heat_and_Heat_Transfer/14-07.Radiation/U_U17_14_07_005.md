## Question Section 

<b>
Find the net rate of heat transfer by radiation from a skier standing in the shade, given the following: she is completely clothed in white (head to foot, including a ski mask), the clothes have an emissivity of(e) and a surface temperature of(T1C ^circC), the surroundings are at(T2C ^circC), and her surface area is(A)(m^2).
ans_rule(40)(W)

## E
and a surface temperature of(T1C ^circC), the surroundings are at(T2C ^circC), and her surface area is(A)(m^2).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(1.32,1.65,0.01)
T1C = randrange(10,15,1)
T2C = randrange(-15,-10,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
T2 = (T2C+273.15)**4
T = T2-T1
e = 0.200
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
P = o*e*A*T
