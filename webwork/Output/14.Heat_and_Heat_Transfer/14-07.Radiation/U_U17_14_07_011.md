## Question Section 

<b>
A shirtless rider under a circus tent feels the heat radiating from the sunlit portion of the tent. Calculate the temperature of the tent canvas based on the following information: The shirtless rider's skin temperature is(T1C ^circC) and has an emissivity of(e). The exposed area of skin is(Am^2). He receives radiation at the rate of(Qt)(W)—half what you would calculate if the entire region behind him was hot. The rest of the surroundings are at(T1C ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(K)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

e = 0.97
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
A = randrange(0.375,0.425,0.001)
T1C = randrange(33,38,1)
T1 = (T1C+273.15)**4
Qt = randrange(20,30,1)
T2 = (T1+((2*Qt)/(o*e*A)))**(1/4)
