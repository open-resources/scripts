## Question Section 

<b>
A large body of lava from a volcano has stopped flowing and is slowly cooling. The interior of the lava is at(TinC ^circC), its surface is at(TsaC ^circC), and the surroundings are at(TsurrC ^circC).
a) Calculate the rate at which energy is transferred by radiation from(A)(m^2) of surface lava into the surroundings, assuming the emissivity is(e).
ans_rule(40)(W)

## A
Calculate the rate at which energy is transferred by radiation from(A)(m^2) of surface lava into the surroundings, assuming the emissivity is(e).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

e = sprintf("%0.2f",1)
o = 5.67*(10**-8)
k = 0.84
TinC = randrange(1200,1250,1)
Tin = (TinC+273.15)**4
TsaC = randrange(400,450,1)
Tsa = (TsaC+273.15)**4
TsurrC = randrange(23,28,1)
Tsurr = (TsurrC+273.15)**4
A = randrange(1,2,1)
Ta = Tsurr-Tsa
Tb = TinC-TsaC
P = o*e*A*Ta
d = (k*A*Tb)/(-P)
