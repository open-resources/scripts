## Question Section 

<b>
Integrated Concepts: A large electrical power facility produces(QMW)(MW) of “waste heat,” which is dissipated to the environment in cooling towers by warming air flowing through the towers by(T ^circC). What is the necessary flow rate of air in(m^3)(s)?
ans_rule(40)(m^3)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

QMW = randrange(1600,1700,1)
Q = QMW*(10**6)
c = 721
T = randrange(5,9,1)
p = 1.29
m = Q/(c*T)
V = m/p
