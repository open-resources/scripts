## Question Section 

<b>
Unreasonable Results: Calculate the rate of heat transfer by conduction through a
window with an area(A)(m^2) of that is(dcm)(cm) thick, if its inner surface is at(T1 ^circC) and its outer surface is at(T2 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


k = 0.84
T2 = randrange(32,35,1)
T1 = randrange(20,23,1)
T = T2-T1
A = 1
dcm = randrange(0.700,0.8,0.001)
d = dcm/100
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
