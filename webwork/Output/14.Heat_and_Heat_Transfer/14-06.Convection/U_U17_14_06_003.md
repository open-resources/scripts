## Question Section 

<b>
The “steam” above a freshly made cup of instant coffee is really water vapour droplets condensing after evaporating from the hot coffee. What is the final temperature of(mc)(g) of hot coffee initially at(Ti^circC) if(me)(g) evaporates from it? The coffee is in a Styrofoam cup, so other methods of heat transfer can be neglected. Assume the coffee has the same thermal properties of water.
ans_rule(40)(^circC)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Ti = randrange(85,93,1)
mc = randrange(230,250,1)
me = randrange(2,3,1)
M = mc-me
c = 4186
Lv = 2256000
T = (me*Lv)/(M*c)
Tf = Ti-T
