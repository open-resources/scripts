## Question Section 

<b>
The energy released from condensation in thunderstorms can be very large. Calculate the energy released into the atmosphere for a small storm of radius(1)(km), assuming that(1.0)(cm) of rain is precipitated uniformly over this area.
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

showHint = 3

p = 1000
V = 0.01*(pi*(10**6))
m = p*V
Lv = 2430000
Q = (m*Lv)
