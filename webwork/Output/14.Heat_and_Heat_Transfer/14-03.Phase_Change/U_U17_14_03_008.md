## Question Section 

<b>
In 1986, a gargantuan iceberg broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. It was approximately a rectangle(lkm)(km) long,(wkm)(km) wide, and(h)(m) thick. (a) What is the mass of this iceberg, given that the density of ice is(p)(kgm^3)? 
ans_rule(40) (kg)

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

p = 917
lkm = randrange(130,170,1)
l = lkm*(10**3)
wkm = randrange(30,40,1)
w = wkm*(10**3)
h = randrange(240,260,1)
m = p*l*w*h
Lf = 79.8
hour = randrange(12,14,1)
Q = m*Lf*4186
Qday = 100*l*w*(hour*3600)
n = (Q/Qday)*(1/365.25)
