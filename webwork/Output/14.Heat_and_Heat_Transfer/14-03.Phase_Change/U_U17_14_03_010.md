## Question Section 

<b>
It is difficult to extinguish a fire on a crude oil tanker, because each litre of crude oil releases(2.80times 10^7)(J) of energy when burned. To illustrate this difficulty, calculate the number of litres of water that must be expended to absorb the energy released by burning(1.00)(L) of crude oil, if the water has its temperature raised from(T1 ^circC) to(T2 ^circC), it boils, and the resulting steam is raised to(T3 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(L)



## Answer Section

showHint = 3

T1 = 20.0
T2 = 100.0
T3 = 300.0
Q = 2.8*(10**7)
Lv = 2256000
cw = 4186
Tw = T2-T1
cs = 1520
Ts = T3-T2
m = Q/((cw*Tw)+Lv+(cs*Ts))
V = m*(1/1000)*1000    #1m^3/1000kg * 1000L/1m^3
