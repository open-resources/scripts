## Question Section 

<b>
A(mal)-(kg) aluminum bowl holding(ms)(kg) of soup at(T ^circC) is placed in a freezer. What is the final temperature if(377)(kJ) of energy is transferred from the bowl and soup, assuming the soup's thermal properties are the same as that of water?
ans_rule(40)(^circC)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mal = randrange(0.175,0.250,0.021)
cal = 900
ms = randrange(0.8,0.9,0.011)
cs = 4186
ci = 2090                                             #specific heat of frozen soup
Lf = 334000
T = 25
Q = (mal*cal*T)+(ms*cs*T)     #heat removed to bring soup and aluminum to zero Celsius
Q1 = (ms*Lf)+Q                            #heat removed to freeze soup
Q11 = 377000-Q1                            #heat remaining to further cool aluminum and frozen soup
Tf = (-Q11)/((mal*cal)+(ms*ci))
