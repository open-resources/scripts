from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(0.120,0.200,0.011)
ci = 2.090
T1 = 20
Q1 = m*ci*T1
Lf = 334
Q2 = m*Lf
T3 = 100
cw = 4.186
Q3 = m*cw*T3
Lv = 2256
Q4 = m*Lv
T5 = 30
cv = 1.520
Q5 = m*cv*T5
Q = Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5
P = 20
t1 = Q1/P
t2 = Q2/P
t3 = Q3/P
t4 = Q4/P
t5 = Q5/P
t = t1+t2+t3+t4+t5
