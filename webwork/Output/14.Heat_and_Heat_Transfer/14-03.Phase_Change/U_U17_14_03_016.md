## Question Section 

<b>
Indigenous people sometimes cook in watertight baskets by placing hot rocks into water to bring it to a boil. What mass of(T1 ^circC) rock must be placed in(mrock)(kg) of(T2 ^circC) water to bring its temperature to(Te ^circC), if(mv)(kg) of water escapes as vapour from the initial sizzle? You may neglect the effects of the surroundings and take the average specific heat of the rocks to be that of granite.
ans_rule(40)(kg)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mrock = randrange(4,5,1)
mv = randrange(0.0200,0.0250,0.0001)
mw = mrock-mv
Te = 100
T2 = randrange(11,15,1)
T1 = randrange(500,520,1)
Lv = 2256*(10**3)
cw = 4186
cr = 840
mr = ((mv*Lv)+(mw*cw*(Te-T2)))/(cr*(T1-Te))
