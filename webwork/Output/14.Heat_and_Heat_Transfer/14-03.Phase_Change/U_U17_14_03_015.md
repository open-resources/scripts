## Question Section 

<b>
If you pour(mw)(kg) of(20.0 ^circC) water onto a(mi)-(kg) block of ice initially at(-15.0 ^circC), what is the final temperature? You may assume that the water cools so rapidly that effects of the surroundings are negligible.
ans_rule(40)(^circC)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mw = randrange(0.0100,0.0130,0.0001)
mi = randrange(1.10,1.20,0.01)
Lf = 334*(10**3)
cw = 4186
ci = 2090
denom = ci*(mw+mi)
Tf = (((mw*cw*20)+(mw*Lf))-(mi*ci*15))/denom
