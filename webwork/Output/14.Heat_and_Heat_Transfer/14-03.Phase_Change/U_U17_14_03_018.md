## Question Section 

<b>
In some countries, liquid nitrogen is used on dairy trucks instead of mechanical refrigerators. A(3.00)-hour delivery trip requires(200)(L) of liquid nitrogen, which has a density of(pkgm^3).
a) Calculate the heat transfer necessary to evaporate this amount of liquid nitrogen and raise its temperature to(3.00 ^circC). (Use and assume it is constant over the temperature range.) This value is the amount of cooling the liquid nitrogen supplies. Assume conditions of constant pressure.
ans_rule(40)(kcal)

## A
Calculate the heat transfer necessary to evaporate this amount of liquid nitrogen and raise its temperature to(3.00 ^circC). (Use and assume it is constant over the temperature range.) This value is the amount of cooling the liquid nitrogen supplies. Assume conditions of constant pressure.

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

p = 808
L = 200*(10**-3)
m = p*L
Lv = 48
cp = 0.248
T = 3+195.8
Q = m*(Lv+(cp*T))
cw = 4186/(3.6*(10**6))
kWh = Q*cw
Qice = m*79.8
