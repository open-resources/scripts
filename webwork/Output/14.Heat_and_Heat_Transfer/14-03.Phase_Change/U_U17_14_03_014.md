### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mice = randrange(0.0400,0.0500,0.0001)
mwater = randrange(0.400,0.500,0.001)
cice = 2090
cwater = 4186
Tice = sprintf("%0.1f",-30.0)
TiceK = Tice +273.15
Twater = sprintf("%0.1f",35.0)
TwaterK = Twater+273.15
Lf = 334000
Q1 = -((30*mice*cice)+(mice*Lf))          #heat removed from water to melt ice
Tf = (Q1+cwater*(273.15*mice+TwaterK*mwater))/(cwater*(mice+mwater))-273.15
