## Question Section 

<b>
Some stove tops are smooth ceramic for easy cleaning. If the ceramic is(dcm)(cm) thick and heat conduction occurs through an area of(Acmtimes10^-2)(m^2) and at a rate of(QtkW)(kW), what is the temperature difference across it? Ceramic has the same thermal conductivity as glass and brick.
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(0.5,0.6,0.001)
d = dcm/100
Acm = randrange(1.30,1.60,0.01)
A = Acm*(10**-2)
k = 0.84
Qt = 2256
QtkW = Qt/1000
T = (d*Qt)/(k*A)
