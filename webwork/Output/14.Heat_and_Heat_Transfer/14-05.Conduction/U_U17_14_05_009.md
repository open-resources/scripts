## Question Section 

<b>
Compare the rate of heat conduction through a(dcmwall)-(cm)-thick wall that has an area of(Awall)(m^2) and a thermal conductivity twice that of glass wool with the rate of heat conduction through a window that is(dcmwindow)(cm) thick and that has an area of(Awindow)(m^2), assuming the same temperature difference across each.
ans_rule(40)(wall : window)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcmwall = randrange(12,15,1)
dwall = dcmwall/100
dcmwindow = randrange(0.690,0.75,0.01)
dwindow = dcmwindow/100
Awall = randrange(10,13,1)
Awindow = randrange(2,4,1)
kwall = 2*0.042
kwindow = 0.84
Qtwall = kwall*Awall*dwindow
Qtwindow = kwindow*Awindow*dwall
ratiowallwindow = Qtwall/Qtwindow
