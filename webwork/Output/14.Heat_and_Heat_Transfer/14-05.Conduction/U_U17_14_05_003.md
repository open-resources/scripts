## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the rate of heat conduction out of the human body, assuming that the core internal temperature is(T2 ^circC), the skin temperature is(T1 ^circC), the thickness of the tissues between averages(dcm)(cm), and the surface area is(A)(m^2).
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(1,3,1)
d = dcm/100
T2 = randrange(37,39,1)
T1 = randrange(33,36,1)
A = randrange(1.10,1.40,0.01)
k = 0.2
T = T2-T1
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
