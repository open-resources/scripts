## Question Section 

<b>
a) A firewalker runs across a bed of hot coals without sustaining burns. Calculate the heat transferred by conduction into the sole of one foot of a firewalker given that the bottom of the foot is a(dmm)-(mm)-thick callus with a conductivity at the low end of the range for wood and its density is(p)(kgm^3). The area of contact is(Acm)(cm^2), the temperature of the coals is(T2^circC), and the time in contact is(t)(s).

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dmm = randrange(2,5,1)
d = dmm/1000
t = 1.00
p = 300
T2 = randrange(700,759,1)
T1 = 37
Acm = randrange(19,26,1)
A = Acm*(10**-4)
k = 0.08
T = T2-T1
Vcm =Acm
V = Vcm*(10**-6)
c = 3500
Q = (k*A*T*t)/d
Tb = Q/(p*V*c)
