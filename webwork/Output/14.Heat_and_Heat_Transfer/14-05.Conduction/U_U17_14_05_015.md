## Question Section 

<b>
For the human body, what is the rate of heat transfer by conduction through the body's tissue with the following conditions: the tissue thickness is(dcm)(cm), the change in temperature is(T^circC), and the skin area is(A)(m^2). How does this compare with the average heat transfer rate to the body resulting from an energy intake of about(2400)(kcal) per day? (No exercise is included).
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

showHint = 3

dcm = sprintf("%0.2f",3)
d = dcm/100
A = 1.50
k = 0.2
T = 2
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
percent = (1728/10050)*100
