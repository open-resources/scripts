![Walrus.]("NU_U17_14_05_008.png")

<b>
A walrus transfers energy by conduction through its blubber at the rate of(Qt)(W) when immersed in(T1^circC) water. The walrus's internal core temperature is(T2^circC), and it has a surface area of(A)(m^2). What is the average thickness of its blubber, which has the conductivity of fatty tissues without blood?
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Qt = randrange(120,150,1)
T2 = randrange(36,39,1)
T1 = randrange(-2,-1,1)
A = randrange(2,4,1)
k = 0.2
T = T2-T1
d = (k*A*T)/Qt
