## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the rate of heat conduction through house walls that are(dcm)(cm) thick and that have an average thermal conductivity twice that of glass wool. Assume there are no windows or doors. The surface area of the walls is(A)(m^2) and their inside surface is at(T2 ^circC), while their outside surface is at(T1 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(12,15,1)
d = dcm/100
T2 = randrange(16,19,1)
T1 = randrange(3,6,1)
A = randrange(110,130,1)
k = 2*0.042
T = T2-T1
Qt = (k*A*T)/d
