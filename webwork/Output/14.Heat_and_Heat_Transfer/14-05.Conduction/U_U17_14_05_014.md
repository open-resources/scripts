## Question Section 

<b>
Many decisions are made on the basis of the payback period: the time it will take through savings to equal the capital cost of an investment. Acceptable payback times depend upon the business or philosophy one has. (For some industries, a payback period is as small as two years.) Suppose you wish to install an extra(8.00)(cm) of fiberglass insulation to the attic of a single-story house measuring(10)(m) by(15)(m) by(3.0)(m) and that is already insulated with(15)-(cm)-thick fiberglass on all exterior surfaces and the attic. If energy cost (1.00) per million joules and the insulation was (4.00) per square meter, then calculate the simple payback time. Take the average temperature difference between the house's interior and exterior for the(120) day heating season to be(T^circC). Assume that the floor is also insulated and that fiberglass has the same thermal conductivity as glass wool.

showHint = 3

Qt = 126
days = 120*86400
T = 15
Q = Qt*days*T
years = 600/235
