## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you stand with one foot on ceramic flooring and one foot on a wool carpet, making contact over an area of(Acm)(cm^2) with each foot. Both the ceramic and the carpet are(dcm)(cm) thick and are(T1^circC) on their bottom sides. Take the thermal conductivity of ceramic to be that same as that of concrete.
a) At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the ceramic at(T2^circC)?
b) At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the carpet at(T2^circC)?

## A
At what rate must heat transfer occur from each foot to keep the top of the ceramic at(T2^circC)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

dcm = randrange(2,4,1)
d = dcm/100
T2 = randrange(30,33,1)
T1 = randrange(7,10,1)
Acm = randrange(70,90,1)
A = Acm*(10**-4)
ka = 0.84
kb = 0.04
T = T2-T1
Qta = (ka*A*T)/d
Qtb = (kb*A*T)/d
