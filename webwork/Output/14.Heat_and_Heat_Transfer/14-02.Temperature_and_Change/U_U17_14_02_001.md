## Question Section 

<b>
On a hot day, the temperature of an(V)-(L) swimming pool increases by(degree ^circC). What is the net heat transfer during this heating? Ignore any complications, such as loss of water by evaporation.
ans_rule(40)(J)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = randrange(80000,83000,1)
degree = randrange(1.3,1.6,0.1)
p = 1000
c = 4186
m = p*V*(1/1000)
Q = m*c*degree
