## Question Section 

<b>
A(m)-(kg) block of a pure material is heated from(T1 ^circC) to(T2 ^circC) by the addition of(QkJ)(kJ) of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed.
ans_rule(40)(kcalkg(^circC)
The material having this specific heat capacity isans_rule(20)

## G
block of a pure material is heated from(T1 ^circC) to(T2 ^circC) by the addition of(QkJ)(kJ) of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

T1 = sprintf("%0.1f",20)
T2 = sprintf("%0.1f",65)
T = T2-T1
m = 0.250
QkJ = 4.35
Qkcal = QkJ/4.186
c = Qkcal/(m*T)
