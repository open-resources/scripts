## Question Section 

<b>
Rubbing your hands together warms them by converting work into thermal energy. If a woman rubs her hands back and forth for a total of(N) rubs, at a distance of(dcm)(cm) per rub, and with an average frictional force of(F)(N), what is the temperature increase? The mass of tissues warmed is only(m)(kg), mostly in the palms and fingers.
ans_rule(40)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(0.100,0.200,0.01)
N = randrange(10,20,1)
dcm = randrange(7,8,0.02)
d = dcm*(10**-2)
c = 3500
F = randrange(40,50,1)
T = (N*F*d)/(m*c)
