## Question Section 

<b>
Following vigorous exercise, the body temperature of an(m)-(kg) person is(T2 ^circC). At what rate in watts must the person transfer thermal energy to reduce the body temperature to(T1 ^circC) in(tmin)(min), assuming the body continues to produce energy at the rate of(Pbody)(W)?
ans_rule(40)(W)

## G
person is(T2 ^circC). At what rate in watts must the person transfer thermal energy to reduce the body temperature to(T1 ^circC) in(tmin)(min), assuming the body continues to produce energy at the rate of(Pbody)(W)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(75,85,1)
c = 3500
T1 = randrange(34,38,1)
T2 = randrange(40,43,1)
T = T2-T1
tmin = randrange(25,35,1)
t = tmin*60
Q = m*c*T
Pcooling = Q/t
Pbody = randrange(120,150,1)
Prequired = Pcooling+Pbody
