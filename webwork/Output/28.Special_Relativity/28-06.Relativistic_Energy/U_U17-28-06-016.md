## Question Section 

Find the kinetic energy in MeV of a neutron with a measured life span of(2065) s, given its rest energy is(mc) MeV, and rest life span is(900) s.
Use(gamma) =(gamma).
ans_rule(40) MeV

## A
=(gamma).
### Answer Section
## C
MeV, and rest life span is(900) s.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

gamma = 2.2944
mc = 939.6
KineticEnergy = (gamma-1)*mc
