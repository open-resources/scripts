## Question Section 

a) Calculate the energy released by the destruction of(Mass) kg of mass. 
ans_rule(40) J
b) How many kilograms could be lifted to a(heightkm) km height by this amount of energy?
ans_rule(40) kg

## A
Calculate the energy released by the destruction of(Mass) kg of mass. 
### Answer Section
## B
How many kilograms could be lifted to a(heightkm) km height by this amount of energy?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Mass = randrange(1,2,0.1)
heightkm = randrange(10,20,1)
height = heightkm*1000
c = 2.998*(10**8)
gravity = 9.8
Energy = Mass*(c**2)
mass = Energy/(gravity*height)
