## Question Section 

A(pi)-meson is a particle that decays into a muon and a massless particle. The(pi)-
meson has a rest mass energy of(Energypi) MeV, and the muon has a rest mass energy of(Energyu) MeV. Suppose the(pi)-meson is at rest and all of the missing mass goes into the muon's kinetic energy. How fast will the muon move?

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Energyu = 105.7
Energypi = 139.6
gamma = Energypi/Energyu
c = 2.998*(10**8)
velocity = sqrt(1-(1/(gamma**2)))
