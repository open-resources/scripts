## Question Section 

What is the kinetic energy in MeV of a(pi)-meson that lives(1.40times 10^-16) s as measured in the laboratory, and(0.840times 10^-16) s when at rest relative to an observer, given that its rest energy is(mc) MeV?
Use(gamma) =(gamma).
ans_rule(40) MeV

## A
=(gamma).
### Answer Section
## C
MeV?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

gamma = 1.667
mc = 135
KineticEnergy = (gamma-1)*mc
