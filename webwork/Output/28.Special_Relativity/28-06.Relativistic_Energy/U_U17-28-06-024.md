## Question Section 

Suppose you use an average of(kWh) kWh of electric energy per month in your home.
a) How long would(mass) g of mass converted to electric energy with an efficiency of(percent)% last you? 
ans_rule(40) years
b) How many homes could be supplied at the(kWh) kWh per month rate for one year by the energy from the described mass conversion?
ans_rule(40) homes

## A
How long would(mass) g of mass converted to electric energy with an efficiency of(percent)% last you? 
### Answer Section
## B
How many homes could be supplied at the(kWh) kWh per month rate for one year by the energy from the described mass conversion?
### Answer Section
## H
kWh of electric energy per month in your home.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

c = 2.998*(10**8)
percent = randrange(34,40,1)
mass = randrange(1,2,0.1)
kWh = randrange(500,600,1)
monthlyenergy = kWh*3600*1000
Energy = (percent/100)*(mass/1000)*(c**2)
years = (Energy/monthlyenergy)*(1/12)
