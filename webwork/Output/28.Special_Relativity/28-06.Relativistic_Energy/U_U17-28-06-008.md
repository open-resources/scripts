## Question Section 

There is approximately(10^34) J of energy available from fusion of hydrogen in the
world's oceans. 
a) If(10^33) J of this energy were utilized, what would be the decrease in mass of the oceans? 
Assume that about(percent)% of the mass of a water molecule is converted to energy during the fusion of hydrogen. 
ans_rule(40) kg
b) How great a volume of water does this correspond to?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Energy = 10**33
c = 2.998*(10**8)
percent = randrange(0.06,0.08,0.01)
percenta = percent/100
mass = (Energy/(c**2))*(1/percenta)
volume = mass/1000
