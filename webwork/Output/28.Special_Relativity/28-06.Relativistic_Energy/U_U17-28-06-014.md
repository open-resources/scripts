## Question Section 

A positron is an antimatter version of the electron, having exactly the same mass. When a positron and an electron meet, they annihilate, converting all of their mass into energy. 
a) Find the energy released, assuming negligible kinetic energy before the annihilation. 
 J
b) If this energy is given to a proton in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity? 
c) If this energy is given to another electron in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

mass = 9.11*(10**-31)
massn = 1.67*(10**-27)
c = (2.998*(10**8))**2
KineticEnergy = 2*mass*c
KineticEnergya = KineticEnergy*10**13
gammab = (KineticEnergy+(massn*c))/(massn*c)
velocityb = (1-(1/(gammab**2)))**(1/2) 
velocityc = (1-(1/(3**2)))**(1/2)
