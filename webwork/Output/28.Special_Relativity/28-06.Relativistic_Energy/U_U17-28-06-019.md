for a proton having a mass energy of(mc) MeV accelerated through an effective potential of(1.0) TV (teravolt) at Fermilab outside Chicago?
### Answer Section
## C
MeV accelerated through an effective potential of(1.0) TV (teravolt) at Fermilab outside Chicago?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

q = 1.6*10**-19
mc = 938.3
V = 1*10**12
meV = 1/(1.6*10**-13)
gamma = ((q*V*meV)+mc)/mc
