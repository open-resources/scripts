(Energy1) and(Energy2) MeV respectively, what is the difference in their masses in kilograms?
 kg

are
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Energy1 = randrange(937.7,938.5,0.1)
Energy2 = randrange(939,939.8,0.1)
c = 2.998*(10**8)
mass = (((Energy2-Energy1)*(1.6*(10**-13)))/(c**2))*10**30
