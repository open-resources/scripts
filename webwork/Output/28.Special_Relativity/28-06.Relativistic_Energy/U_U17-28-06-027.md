## Question Section 

The Sun produces energy at a rate of(4.00times 10^26) W by the fusion of hydrogen. 
a) How many kilograms of hydrogen undergo fusion each second? 
ans_rule(40) kgs
b) If the Sun is(90.0)% hydrogen and half of this can undergo fusion before the Sun changes character, how long could it produce energy at its current rate? 
ans_rule(40) years
 
c) How many kilograms of mass is the Sun losing per second? 
ans_rule(40) kg
 
d) What fraction of its mass will it have lost in the time found in part (b)?
ans_rule(40) %

## Answer Section

showHint = 3

SunEnergy = 4*(10**26)
c = 2.998*(10**8)
kgs = SunEnergy/(6.4*(10**14))
timeseconds = 0.450*((1.99*(10**30))/(kgs))
years = timeseconds/(3.1536*(10**7))
massc = SunEnergy/(c**2)
percentd = ((massc*timeseconds)/(1.99*(10**30)))*100
