## Question Section 

A supernova explosion of a(masstimes 10^31) kg star produces(Energytimes 10^44) J of energy. 
a) How many kilograms of mass are converted to energy in the explosion? 
ans_rule(40) kg
b) What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass of the star?
ans_rule(40)

## A
How many kilograms of mass are converted to energy in the explosion? 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass of the star?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Energy = randrange(1,1.3,0.01)
Energya = Energy*(10**44)
mass = randrange(2,3,0.01)
massstar = mass*10**31
c = 2.998*(10**8)
Mass = Energya/(c**2)
ratio = Mass/massstar
