## Question Section 

A muon has a rest mass energy of(Energy) MeV, and it decays into an electron and a
massless particle. 
a) If all the lost mass is converted into the electron's kinetic energy, find(gamma) for the electron. 
ans_rule(40) 
b) What is the electron's velocity?
ans_rule(40) ms

## A
If all the lost mass is converted into the electron's kinetic energy, find(gammfor the electron. 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the electron's velocity?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Energy = 105.7
Energye = 0.511
gamma = (Energy+Energye)/Energye
c = 2.998*(10**8)
velocity = c*(1-(1/(gamma**2)))**(1/2)
