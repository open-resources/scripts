## Question Section 

a) Calculate the amount of mass converted to energy by the fusion of(1.00) kg of hydrogen given that each kilogram releases(6.4times10^14).
ans_rule(40) kg
b) What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass?
ans_rule(40)

## A
Calculate the amount of mass converted to energy by the fusion of(1.00) kg of hydrogen given that each kilogram releases(6.4times10^14).
### Answer Section
## B
What is the ratio of mass destroyed to the original mass?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

Energy = 6.4*(10**14)
c = 2.998*(10**8)
Mass = Energy/(c**2)
ratio = Mass/1
