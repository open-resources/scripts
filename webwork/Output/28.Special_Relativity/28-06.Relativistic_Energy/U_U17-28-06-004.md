## Question Section 

The Big Bang that began the universe is estimated to have released(10^68) J of energy. How many stars could half this energy create, assuming the average star's mass is(masstimes 10^30) kg?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Energy = 1*(10**68)
mass = randrange(4,5,0.01)
massstar = mass*10**30
c = 2.998*(10**8)
Mass = (0.5*Energy)/(c**2)
ratio = Mass/massstar
