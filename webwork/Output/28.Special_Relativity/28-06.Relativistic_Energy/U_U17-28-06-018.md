## Question Section 

One cosmic ray neutron has a velocity of(velocity)(c) relative to the Earth. 
a) What is the neutron's total energy in MeV? 
Use(mc^2) =(mc).
ans_rule(40) MeV
b) Find its momentum.

## A
What is the neutron's total energy in MeV? 
### Answer Section
## B
Find its momentum.
### Answer Section
## C
relative to the Earth. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

showHint = 3

velocity = 0.25
mc = 939.6
c = 2.998*(10**8)
gamma = sqrt(1-((velocity)**2))
KineticEnergy = (1/gamma)*mc
momentum = velocity*KineticEnergy
