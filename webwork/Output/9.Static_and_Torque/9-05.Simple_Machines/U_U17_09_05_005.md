## Question Section 

![Nail Puller]("NU_U17_09_05_005.png")

.<b>
What force does the nail puller in the figure above exert on the supporting surface? The nail puller has a mass of(m) kg, an input lever arm of(li)(cm), and an output lever arm of(lo)(cm). The hand applies a force of(Fi)(N) on the nail puller. Note: Assume that the weight of the nail puller acts at the midway point of the input lever arm.
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

m = 2.10
li = 45
lo= 1.8
Fi = 50
N = (Fi*li+m*9.8*li/2)/(lo)+Fi+(m)*9.8
