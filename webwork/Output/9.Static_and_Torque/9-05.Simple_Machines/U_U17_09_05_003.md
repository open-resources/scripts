## A
What is the mechanical advantage of a wheelbarrow, such as the one in the figure above, if the centre of gravity of the wheelbarrow and its load has a perpendicular lever arm of(lo)(cm), while the hands have a perpendicular lever arm of(li)(m)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

lo = 5.50
li = 1.02
m = 55
g = 9.8
MA = li/(lo/100)
Fi = (m*g)/MA
N = Fi*(MA-1)
