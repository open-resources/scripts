![Nail Puller]("NU_U17_09_05_001.png")

<b>
What is the mechanical advantage of a nail puller—similar to the one shown in the figure above—where you exert a force(d)(cm) from the pivot and the nail is(d2)(cm) on the other side?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(40,47,1)
d2 = randrange(1.45,1.98,0.01)
Fb = randrange(1200,1300,1)
MA = d/d2
Fo = Fb/MA
