<b>
A gymnast is attempting to perform splits. From the information given in the above figure, calculate the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on each foot by the floor.
ans_rule(40)(N) atans_rule(10) degrees from the ground



## Answer Section

w = 700
Fhorizontal = 1.5*(w)
Fvertical = 0.5*(w)
theta = arctan((Fvertical)/(Fhorizontal))*(180/pi)
Ftotal = sqrt((Fhorizontal)**2+(Fvertical)**2)
