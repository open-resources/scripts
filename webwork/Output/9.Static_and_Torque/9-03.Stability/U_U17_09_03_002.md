## Question Section 

<b>
Two children of mass(m1)(kg) and(m2)(kg) sit balanced on a seesaw with the pivot point located at the center of the seesaw. If the children are separated by a distance of(r)(m), at what distance from the pivot point is the small child sitting in order to maintain the balance?
ans_rule(40)(m)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m1 = randrange(17,23,1)
m2 = randrange(27,33,1)
r = randrange(3,3.99,0.01)
r2 = ((m2/m1)+1)
rr2 = r/r2
r1 = r-rr2
