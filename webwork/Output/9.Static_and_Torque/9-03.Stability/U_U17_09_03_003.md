![Horse and Rider]("NU_U17_09_03_003.png")

<b>
a) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force on each foot of the horse in
the above figure (two are on the ground), assuming the centre of mass of the horse is
midway between the feet. The total mass of the horse and rider is(m)(kg).
ans_rule(40)(N) acting atans_rule(10) degrees from the vertical (wall)

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

m = 500
Fwall = 8575/6
F = sqrt((m*4.9)**2+(0.5*Fwall)**2)
degrees = 90-arctan((m*4.9)/(Fwall/2))*180/pi
w = 4900
us = Fwall/w
