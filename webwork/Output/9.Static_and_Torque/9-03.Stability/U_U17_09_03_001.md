## Question Section 

![Horse and Rider]("NU_U17_09_03_001.png")

<b>
Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in the figure above. Calculate the force exerted on
the wall assuming that force is horizontal. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal and
opposite to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. The total mass of
the horse and rider is(m)(kg).
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

m = 500
g = 9.8
Fwall = (0.35*m*g)/1.2
