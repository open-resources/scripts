## Question Section 

<b>
A person carries a plank of wood(d)(m) long with one hand pushing down on it at one end with a force(F_1) and the other hand holding it up with a force of(F_2) applied at a distance of(r2)(m) from the same end of the plank. The plank has a mass of(m1)(kg) and its centre of gravity is at the middle of the plank.
a) What is the force(F_1)?
ans_rule(40)(N)

## A
What is the force(F_1)?
### Answer Section
## G
and its centre of gravity is at the middle of the plank.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(2,4,1)
r1 = d/2
r2 = randrange(0.4,0.6,0.001)
m1 = randrange(20,25,1)
g = 9.8
F1 = (m1*g)*((r1-r2)/(r2))
F2 = (m1*g)+F1
