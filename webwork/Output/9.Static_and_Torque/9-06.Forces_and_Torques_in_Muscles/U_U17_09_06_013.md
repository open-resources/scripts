## Question Section 

<b>
You have just planted a sturdy(length2)(m)-tall palm tree in your front lawn for your mother's
birthday. Your brother kicks a(massgrams)(g) ball, which hits the top of the tree at a speed of(velocity)(ms) and stays in contact with it for(timems)(ms). The ball falls to the ground near the base of the tree and the recoil of the tree is minimal. 
a) What is the magnitude of the force on the tree? 
ans_rule(40)(N)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

lengthcm = randrange(20,30,1)
length1 = lengthcm/100
length2 = randrange(2,5,1)
massgrams = randrange(500,600,1)
mass = massgrams/1000
velocity = randrange(5,9,1)
timems = randrange(10,15,1)
time = timems/1000
Force = (mass*velocity)/time
Forcer = (Force*length2)/length1
