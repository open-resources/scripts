## Question Section 

![Forces on Head]("NU_U17_09_06_005.png")

<b>
A person working at a drafting board may hold her head as shown in the figure above, requiring muscle action to support the head. The three major acting forces are shown. Calculate the direction and magnitude of the force supplied by the upper vertebrae to hold the head stationary, assuming that this force acts along a line through the centre of mass, as do the weight and muscle force.
ans_rule(40)(N) acting at  ans_rule(10) degrees from the positive(x)- axis.



## Answer Section

Fm = 60
W = 50
alpha = 270
radsalpha = alpha*pi/180
beta = 360-33
radsbeta = beta*pi/180

Fx = -((W)*cos(radsalpha)+(Fm)*cos(radsbeta))
Fy = -((W)*sin(radsalpha)+(Fm)*sin(radsbeta))

Ftotal = sqrt((Fx**2)+(Fy**2))

theta = arctan((Fy)/(Fx))*180/pi+180
