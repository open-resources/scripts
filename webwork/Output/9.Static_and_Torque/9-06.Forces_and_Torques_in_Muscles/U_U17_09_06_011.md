## Question Section 

![Forces on Arm]("NU_U17_09_06_011.png")

<b>
Integrated Concepts: Suppose we replace the(mbook)-(kg) book in the figure above with an elastic exercise rope that obeys Hooke's Law and that has a force constant(k) =(k)(Nm).
a) How much is the rope stretched (past equilibrium) to provide the same force as the book? Assume the rope is held in the hand at the same location as the book.

## A
How much is the rope stretched (past equilibrium) to provide the same force as the book? Assume the rope is held in the hand at the same location as the book. 
### Answer Section
## G
book in the figure above with an elastic exercise rope that obeys Hooke's Law and that has a force constant(k) =(k)(Nm).
### Answer Section
## K
=(k)(Nm).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

k = 600
mbook = sprintf("%0.1f",4)
marm = 2.5
dbiceps = 0.04
dcom = 0.16
dbook = 0.38
g = 9.8
angle = 25
anglerads = angle*pi/180

x = ((mbook*g)/k)*100
FB = ((g)/(dbiceps))*cos(anglerads)*((mbook)*(dbook)+(marm)*(dcom))
