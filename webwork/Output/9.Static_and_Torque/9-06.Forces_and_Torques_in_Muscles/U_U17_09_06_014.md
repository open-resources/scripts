## Question Section 

<b>
Unreasonable Results: Suppose two children are using a uniform seesaw that is(3.00)(m) long and has its centre of mass over the pivot. The first child has a mass of(weight1)(kg) and sits(x1)(m) from the pivot. 
a) Calculate where the second(weight2)(kg) child must sit to balance the seesaw.
ans_rule(40)(m) from the opposite end of the seesaw

## A
Calculate where the second(weight2)(kg) child must sit to balance the seesaw.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
weight1 = randrange(30,40,1)
x1 = randrange(1.3,1.6,0.01)
weight2 = randrange(13,19,1)
x2 = (weight1*x1)/weight2
