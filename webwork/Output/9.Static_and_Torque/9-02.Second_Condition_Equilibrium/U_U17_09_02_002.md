## Question Section 

<b>
When tightening a bolt, you push perpendicularly on a wrench with a force of(F)(N) at
a distance of(r)(m) from the centre of the bolt.

ans_rule(40)(N) &middot;(m)

## A
How much torque are you exerting (relative to the centre of the bolt)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(0.138,0.159,0.001)
F = randrange(160,170,1)
torque = r*F
torqueftlb = torque*0.738
