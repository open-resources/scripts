![Children on Seesaw.]("NU_U17_09_02_004.png")

<b>
The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass. The leftmost child has a mass of(m1)(kg) and sits(r1)(m) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of(m2)(kg). Use the second condition for equilibrium to calculate(F_p).
ans_rule(40)(N)

## G
and sits(r1)(m) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of(m2)(kg). Use the second condition for equilibrium to calculate(F_p).

from random import randrange
g = 9.8
m1 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(25,30,0.1))
m2 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(32,36,0.1))
r1 = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1.6,1.65,0.01))
Fp = (m1+m2)*g
