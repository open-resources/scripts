![Children on Seesaw]("NU_U17_09_02_005.png")

<b>
The two children shown in the figure above are balanced on a seesaw. The leftmost child has a mass of(m1)(kg) and sits(r1)(m) from the pivot. The second child has a mass of(m2)(kg). The seesaw has a mass(ms)(kg) and a center of mass located
(rs)(m) to the left of the pivot (on the side of the lighter child).
a) How far from the pivot does the heavier child sit?
ans_rule(40)(m)

r1 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.6,1.65,0.01))

m1 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
m2 = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(32,36,0.1))
g = 9.8
r2 = ((m1*r1)+(ms*rs))/m2
Fp = (m1+m2+ms)*g
