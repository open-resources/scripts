## Question Section 

<b>
To get up on the roof, a person (mass(mman)(kg)) places a(length)-(m) aluminum ladder (mass(mladder)(kg)) against the house on a concrete pad with the base of the ladder(width)(m) from the house. The ladder rests against a plastic rain gutter, which we can assume to be frictionless. The centre of mass of the ladder is(dladder)(m) from the bottom (<i>i.e.<i>(dladder)(m) up its length). The person is standing(dman)(m) from the bottom. What are the magnitudes of the forces on the ladder at the top and bottom?
At the top:ans_rule(40)(N)
At the bottom:ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mman = randrange(70,74,1)
mladder = randrange(10,14,1)
g = 9.8
dman = sprintf("%0.1f",3)
dladder = sprintf("%0.1f",2)
width = sprintf("%0.2f",2)
length = sprintf("%0.2f",6)
height = sqrt((length)**2-(width)**2)
normaltop = ((width)/(length))*(g/6)*(3*(mman)+2*(mladder))
frictionbottom = normaltop*((height)/(length))
normalbottom = (g)*(mman+mladder)-((width)/(length))*(normaltop)
forcebottom=sqrt((frictionbottom)**2+(normalbottom)**2)
