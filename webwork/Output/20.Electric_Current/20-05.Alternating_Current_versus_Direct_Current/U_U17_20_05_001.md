## Question Section 

a) What is the hot resistance of a(W,(W) light bulb that runs on(V,(V) AC?
b) If the bulb's operating temperature is(T1^circ(C) , what is its resistance at(T2^circ(C)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


W = randrange(21,29,2)
V = randrange(110,130,5)
T1 = randrange(2650,2750,50)
T2 = T1-100
E = (V**2)/W
F = E*(1+(4.5*10**-3)*(-100))
