## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


W = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.05)
V = randrange(110,130,10)
area = randrange(4,6,1)
T = randrange(475,525,25)
E = (V**2)/(W*10**3)
P = (1*10**-6)*(1+(4*10**-4)*(T-20))
F = ((area*10**-6)*E)/P
R = E/(1+(4*10**-4)*(T-20))
G = ((V**2)/R)*10**-3
