## Question Section 

Two different electrical devices have the same power consumption, but one is meant to be operated on(V1,(V) AC and the other on(V2,(V) AC.
a) What is the ratio of their resistances?
ans_rule(40)
b) What is the ratio of their currents?
ans_rule(40)
c) Assuming its resistance is unaffected, by what factor will the power increase if a(V1,(V) AC device is connected to(V2,(V) AC?
ans_rule(40)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


V1 = randrange(100,120,10)
V2 = 2*V1
E = (V2/V1)**2
F = (1/E)**(1/2)
G = (V2/V1)**2
