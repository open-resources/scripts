## Question Section 

What current flows through a(d,(cm) diameter rod of pure silicon that is(L,(cm) long, when(V)(times 10^3,(V) is applied to it? (Such a rod may be used to make nuclear- particle detectors, for example.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


L = randrange(18.5,21.5,0.5)
d = randrange(2.38,2.66,0.04)
V = randrange(1.0,1.5,0.1)
R = (2300*(L*10**-2))/(pi*((d*10**-2)/2)**2)
E = (V*10**3)/R
