## Question Section 

Assuming a constant temperature coefficient of resistivity, what is the maximum percent decrease in the resistance of a constantan wire starting at(T^circ(C) ?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


T = randrange(18,22,1)
E = ((2*10**-6)*(-273.16-T))*(-100)
