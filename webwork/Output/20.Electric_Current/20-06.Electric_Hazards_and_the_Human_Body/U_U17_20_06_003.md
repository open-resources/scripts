## Question Section 

Find the current through a person if she touches a(V,(V) AC source:
a) If she is standing on a rubber mat and offers a total resistance of(R1,(k(Omega).
b) If she is standing barefoot on wet grass and has a resistance of only(R2,(Omega).

## A
If she is standing on a rubber mat and offers a total resistance of(R1,(k(Omega).
### Answer Section
## B
If she is standing barefoot on wet grass and has a resistance of only(R2,(Omega).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = randrange(110,130,10)
R1 = randrange(275,325,25)
R2 = randrange(3900,4100,100)
E = (V/(R1*10**3))*10**3
F = (V/R2)*10**3
