## Question Section 

Foolishly trying to fish a burning piece of bread from a toaster with a metal butter knife, a man comes into contact with(V,(V) AC. He does not even feel it since, luckily, he is wearing rubber-soled shoes. What is the minimum resistance of the path the current follows through the person?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = randrange(110,130,10)
E = V/(1*10**-3)
