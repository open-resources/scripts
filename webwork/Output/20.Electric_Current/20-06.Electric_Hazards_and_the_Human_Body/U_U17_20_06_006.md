## Question Section 

During surgery, a current as small as(A)(mu)(A) applied directly to the heart may cause ventricular fibrillation. If the resistance of the exposed heart is(R,(Omega) , what is the smallest voltage that poses this danger?

## A
, what is the smallest voltage that poses this danger?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(18.5,21.5,1.5)
R = randrange(290,310,10)
E = ((A*10**-6)*R)*10**3
