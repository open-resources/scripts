## Question Section 

Electron guns are used in X-ray tubes. The electrons are accelerated through a relatively large voltage and directed onto a metal target, producing X-rays.
a) How many electrons per second strike the target if the current is(A,(mA)?
b) What charge strikes the target in(t,(s)?

## A
How many electrons per second strike the target if the current is(A,(mA)?
### Answer Section
## B
What charge strikes the target in(t,(s)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(0.480,0.530,0.010)
t = randrange(0.700,0.800,0.010)
E = (A*10**-3)/(1.6*10**-19)
F = (A*10**-3)*t
