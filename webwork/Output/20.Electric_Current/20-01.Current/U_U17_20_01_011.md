## Question Section 

The batteries of a submerged non-nuclear submarine supply(C,(A) at full speed ahead. How long does it take to move Avogadro's number ((6.02times 10^23) ) of electrons at this rate?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

C = randrange(950,1050,10)
I = C/(1.6*10**(-19))
E = (6.02*10**23)/I
