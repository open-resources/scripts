## Question Section 

How many volts are supplied to operate an indicator light on a DVD player that has a resistance of(R)(Omega) , given that(A,(mA) passes through it?

## A
, given that(A,(mA) passes through it?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


R = randrange(136,148,2)
A = randrange(23.5,27.5,0.5)
E = (A*10**-3)*R
