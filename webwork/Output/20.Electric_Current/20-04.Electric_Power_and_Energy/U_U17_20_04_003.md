## Question Section 

A charge of(C,(C) of charge passes through a pocket calculator's solar cells in(T,(h). What is the power output, given the calculator's voltage output is(V,(V)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


C = randrange(3.6,4.4,0.2)
T = randrange(3.6,4.4,0.2)
V = randrange(2.8,3.2,0.1)
Tm = T*3600
I = C/Tm
E = I*V
