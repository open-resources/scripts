## Question Section 

What current must be produced by a(V,(V) battery-operated bottle warmer in order to heat(Ma,(g) of glass,(Mb,(g) of baby formula, and(Mc)(times 10^2,(g) of aluminum from(Ta^circ(C) to(Tb^circ(C) in(t,(min) ?

## G
of glass,(Mb,(of baby formula, and(Mc)(times 10^2,(of aluminum from(Ta^circ(C) to(Tb^circ(C) in(t,(min) ?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


V = randrange(11.4,12.6,0.3)
Ma = randrange(67.8,82.2,1.8)
Mb = randrange(232,268,9)
Mc = randrange(2.85,3.15,0.05)
Ta = randrange(17.0,23.0,0.5)
Tb = randrange(85.0,95.0,0.5)
t = randrange(4.0,6.0,0.5)
Q = (((Ma*10**-3)*840)+((Mb*10**-3)*4186)+((Mc*10**-1)*900))*(Tb-Ta)
E = (Q/(t*60))/V
