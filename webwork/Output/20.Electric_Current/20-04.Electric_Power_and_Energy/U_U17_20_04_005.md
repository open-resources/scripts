## Question Section 

Find the power dissipated in each of these extension cords:
a) an extension cord having a(Ra,(Omega) resistance and through which(A,(A) is flowing.
b) a cheaper cord utilizing thinner wire and with a resistance of(Rb,(Omega).

## A
an extension cord having a(Ra,(Omegresistance and through which(A,(A) is flowing.
### Answer Section
## B
a cheaper cord utilizing thinner wire and with a resistance of(Rb,(Omega).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


A = randrange(4.84,5.16,0.04)
Ra = randrange(0.0575,0.0625,0.005)
Rb = randrange(0.280,0.320,0.010)
Va = A*Ra
Vb = A*Rb
E = A*Va
F = A*Vb
