## Question Section 

Hydroelectric generators at Hoover Dam produce a maximum current of(A)(times 10^3)(A) at(V,(kV).
a) What is the power output?
b) The water that powers the generators enters and leaves the system at low speed (thus its kinetic energy does not change) but loses(D,(m) in altitude. How many cubic meters per second are needed, assuming(C,(%) efficiency?
(s)

## A
What is the power output?
### Answer Section
## B
The water that powers the generators enters and leaves the system at low speed (thus its kinetic energy does not change) but loses(D,(m) in altitude. How many cubic meters per second are needed, assuming(C,(%) efficiency?
### Answer Section
## E

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


A = randrange(7.95,8.05,0.05)
V = randrange(248,252,1)
D = randrange(155,165,5)
C = randrange(84,86,1)
E = (A*10**3)*(V*10**3)
Q = E/(9.8*D)
F = (Q*10**-3)*(1/(C/100))
