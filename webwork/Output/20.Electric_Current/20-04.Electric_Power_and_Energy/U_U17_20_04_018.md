## Question Section 

An old lightbulb draws only(Wa,(W), rather than its original(Wb,(W), due to evaporative thinning of its filament. By what factor is its diameter reduced, assuming uniform thinning along its length? Neglect any effects caused by temperature differences.
 reduction in the diameter of the filament



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


Wa = randrange(48.6,51.4,0.07)
Wb = randrange(58.6,61.4,0.07)
E = ((Wa/Wb)**(1/2))*10**2
