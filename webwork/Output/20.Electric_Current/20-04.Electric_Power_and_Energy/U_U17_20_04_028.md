## Question Section 

An immersion heater utilizing(volt,(V) can raise the temperature of a(masscup)(times 10^2,(g) aluminum cup containing(masswater,(g) of water from(T1^circ(C) to(T2^circ(C) in(t,(min). Find its resistance, assuming it is constant during the process.

## G
aluminum cup containing(masswater,(of water from(T1^circ(C) to(T2^circ(C) in(t,(min). Find its resistance, assuming it is constant during the process.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


volt = randrange(112,128,4)
masscup = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.05)
masswater = randrange(325,375,25)
T1 = randrange(19,21,1)
T2 = randrange(90,95,1)
t = randrange(1,3,1)
Q = ((masscup*10**-1)*(900)+(masswater*10**-3)*(4186))*(T2-T1)
E = ((volt**2)*(t*60))/Q
