## Question Section 

00-gauge copper wire has a diameter of(d,(mm). Calculate the power loss in(D,(km) of such a wire when it carries(A)(times 10^2,(A).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


D = randrange(1,3,1)
d = randrange(9.250,9.282,0.004)
A = randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01)
R = ((1.72*10**-8)*(D*10**3))/(pi*(((d*10**-3)/2)**2))
E = ((A*10**2)**2)*R
