## Question Section 

Assuming(eff,(%) efficiency for the conversion of electrical power by the motor, what current must the(volt,(V) batteries of a(mass,(kg) electric car be able to supply:
a) To accelerate from rest to(Va,(ms) in(ta,(min)?
b) To climb a(h)(times 10^2,(m) high hill in(tb,(min) at a constant(Vb,(ms) speed while exerting(Nb)(times 10^2,(N) of force to overcome air resistance and friction?
c) To travel at a constant(Vc,(ms) speed, exerting a(Nc)(times 10^2,(N) force to overcome air resistance and friction?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


eff = randrange(94,96,1)
volt = randrange(11,13,1)
mass = randrange(740,760,10)
Va = randrange(20,30,5)
ta = randrange(0.75,1.25,0.25)
h = randrange(1.90,2.10,0.10)
tb = randrange(1.75,2.25,0.25)
Vb = randrange(20,30,5)
Nb = randrange(4.90,5.10,0.10)
Vc = randrange(20,30,5)
Nc = randrange(4.90,5.10,0.10)
E = (mass*Va**2)/(2*volt*(eff*10**-2)*(ta*60))
energy = ((mass*9.8*(h*10**2))+((Nb*10**2)*Vb*(tb*60)))/(eff*10**-2)
F = energy/(volt*(tb*60))
P = ((Nc*10**2)*Vc)/(eff*10**-2)
G = P/volt
