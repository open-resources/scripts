## Question Section 

a) What current is needed to transmit(W)(times 10^2,(MW) of power at(volt,(kV)?
b) Find the resistance of(Db,(km) of wire that would cause a(ploss,(%) power loss.
c) What is the diameter of a(Dc,(km) long copper wire having this resistance?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


W = randrange(0.98,1.02,0.02)
volt = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.5)
Db = randrange(1.0,2.0,0.5)
ploss = randrange(0.0095,0.0105,0.0005)
Dc = randrange(1.0,2.0,0.5)
E = ((W*10**8)/(volt*10**3))*10**-3
F = ((ploss*10**-2)*(W*10**8))/((E*10**3)**2)
G = ((4*(1.72*10**-8)*(Dc*10**3))/(pi*F))**(1/2)
