## Question Section 

A cauterizer, used to stop bleeding in surgery, puts out(A,(mA) at(V,(kV).
a) What is its power output?
b) What is the resistance of the path?

## A
What is its power output?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the resistance of the path?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


V = randrange(14.92,15.08,0.02)
A = randrange(1.92,2.08,0.04)
E = (A*10**-3)*(V*10**3)
F = ((V*10**3)/(A*10**-3))*10**-6
