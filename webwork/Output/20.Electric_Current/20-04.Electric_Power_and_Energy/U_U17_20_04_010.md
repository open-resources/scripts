## Question Section 

Electrons in an X-ray tube are accelerated through(V)(times 10^2,(kV) and directed toward a target to produce X-rays. Calculate the power of the electron beam in this tube if it has a current of(A,(mA).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


A = randrange(9.0,21.0,2.0)
V = randrange(1.00,1.05,0.01)
E = (A*10**-3)*(V*10**2)
