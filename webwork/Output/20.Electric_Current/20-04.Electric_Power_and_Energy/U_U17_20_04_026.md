## Question Section 

A light-rail commuter train draws(A,(A) of(volt,(V) DC electricity when accelerating.
a) What is its power consumption rate in kilowatts?
b) How long does it take to reach(V,(ms) starting from rest if its loaded mass is(mass)(times 10^4,(kg) , assuming(eff,(%) efficiency and constant power?
c) Find its average acceleration.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


A = randrange(620,640,5)
volt = randrange(645,655,5)
V = randrange(18,22,2)
mass = randrange(5.25,5.35,0.05)
eff = randrange(94,96,1)
E = (A*volt)*10**-3
power = E*(eff*10**-2)
F = (0.5*(mass*10**4)*V**2)/(power*10**3)
G = V/F
