## Question Section 

How much time is needed for a surgical cauterizer to raise the temperature of(Ma,(g) of tissue from(Ta^circ(C) to(Tb^circ(C) and then boil away(Mb,(g) of water, if it puts out(A,(mA) at(V,(kV)? Ignore heat transfer to the surroundings.

## G
of tissue from(Ta^circ(C) to(Tb^circ(C) and then boil away(Mb,(of water, if it puts out(A,(mA) at(V,(kV)? Ignore heat transfer to the surroundings.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


A = randrange(1.98,2.02,0.01)
V = randrange(14.9,15.1,0.1)
Ma = randrange(0.92,1.08,0.04)
Mb = randrange(0.488,0.512,0.003)
Ta = randrange(35,40,1)
Tb = randrange(95,105,5)
Q = ((Ma*10**-3)*300*(Tb-Ta))+((Mb*10**-3)*(2256*10**3))
E = Q/((A*10**-3)*(V*10**3))
