## Question Section 

How many watts does a flashlight that has(C)(times 10^2,(C) pass through it in(T,(h) use if its voltage is(V,(V)?

## H
use if its voltage is(V,(V)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


C = randrange(5.60,6.40,0.20)
T = randrange(0.468,0.532,0.008)
V = randrange(2.60,3.40,0.20)
Tm = T*3600
I = (C*10**2)/Tm
E = I*V
