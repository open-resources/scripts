## Question Section 

What would be the maximum cost of a CFL such that the total cost (investment plus operating) would be the same for both CFL and incandescent(W,(W) bulbs? Assume the cost of the incandescent bulb is(P,(cents) and that electricity costs(Ph,(centskWh) . Calculate the cost for(T,(hours), as in the cost effectiveness of CFL example.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


W = randrange(45,75,5)
T = randrange(500,1500,500)
P = randrange(15,35,5)
Ph = randrange(5.0,15.0,5)
kWh = (W*T)*10**-3
E = (P*10**-2)+((kWh*Ph)*10**-2)
