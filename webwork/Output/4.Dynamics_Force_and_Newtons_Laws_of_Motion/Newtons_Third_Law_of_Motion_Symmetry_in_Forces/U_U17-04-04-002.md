## Question Section 

A brave but inadequate rugby player is being pushed backward by an opposing player who is exerting a force of(force_internalSI,N) on him. The mass of the losing player plus equipment is(mass_smallSI,kg), and he is accelerating at(v,ms^2) backward.
(a) What is the force of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? 
(b) What force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his mass plus equipment is(mass_largeSI,kg)?

## A
What is the force of friction between the losing player's feet and the grass? 
### Answer Section
## B
What force does the winning player exert on the ground to move forward if his mass plus equipment is(mass_largeSI,kg)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mass_largeSI = randrange(110,115,1)
mass_smallSI = randrange(90,95,1)
force_internalSI = randrange(800,850,10)
v = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.0,1.5,0.25))

A1 = (force_internalSI) - (mass_smallSI*v)
s = (mass_largeSI + mass_smallSI)*(v) + A1
