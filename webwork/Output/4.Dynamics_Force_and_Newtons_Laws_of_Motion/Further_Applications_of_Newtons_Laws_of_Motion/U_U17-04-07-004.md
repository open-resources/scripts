## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A(m,kg) dolphin decelerates from(12.0,ms) to(7.50,ms) in(t,s) to join another dolphin in play. What average force was exerted to slow him if he was moving horizontally? (The gravitational force is balanced by the buoyant force of the water.)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= randrange(35.0,45,0.1)
t = randrange(2.25,2.35,0.01)
A = m*(7.5-12)/t
