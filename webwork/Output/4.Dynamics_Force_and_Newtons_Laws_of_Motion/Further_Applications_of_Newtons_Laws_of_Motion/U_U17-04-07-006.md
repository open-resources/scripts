## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A large rocket has a mass of(mtimes 10^6,kg) at takeoff, and its engines produce a thrust of(ttimes 10^7,N).
 
(a) Find its initial acceleration if it takes off vertically. 
(b) How long does it take to reach a velocity of(v,kmh) straight up, assuming constant mass and thrust?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(1.90,2.10,0.01)
t = randrange(3.40,3.60,0.01)
v = randrange(115,125,1)
P1= t*(10**(7))
P2 = m*(10**(6))
P3 = P1/P2 - 9.8
s = v/3.6
P4 = s/(P3)
