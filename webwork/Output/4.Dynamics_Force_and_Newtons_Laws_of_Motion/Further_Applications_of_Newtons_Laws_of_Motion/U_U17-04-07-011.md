## Question Section 

<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> What is the final velocity of a car originally traveling at(v1,kmh) that decelerates at a rate of(a,ms^2) for(t,s)?

## H
that decelerates at a rate of(a,ms^2) for(t,s)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v1 = randrange(45.0,55.0,1.0)
a = randrange(0.380,0.420,0.001)
t = randrange(45,55,1)
A1 = (v1/3.6) - (a*t)
