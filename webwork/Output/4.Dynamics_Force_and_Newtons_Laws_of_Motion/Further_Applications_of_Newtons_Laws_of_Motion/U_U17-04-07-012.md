## Question Section 

<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A(m,kg) man stands on a bathroom scale in an elevator that accelerates from rest to(v,ms) in(t,s). Calculate the scale reading in newtons and compare it with his weight. (The scale exerts an upward force on him equal to its reading.)
Force:
Ratio:ans_rule(40)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(70,77,1)
v = randrange(25.0,35.0,1)
t = randrange(1.80,2.05,0.01)
a = (v)/(t)
F = m*(a+9.8)
R = (F)/(m*9.8)
