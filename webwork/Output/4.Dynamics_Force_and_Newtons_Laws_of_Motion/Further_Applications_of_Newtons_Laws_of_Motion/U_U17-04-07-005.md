## Question Section 

<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> When starting a foot race, a(m,kg) sprinter exerts an average force of(f,N) backward on the ground for(0.800,s).
(a) What is his final speed? 
(b) How far does he travel?

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= randrange(65.0,75.0,1)
f= randrange(645,655,1)
A1 = f*0.8/(m)
A2 = 0.5*f/(m)*(0.8**(2))
