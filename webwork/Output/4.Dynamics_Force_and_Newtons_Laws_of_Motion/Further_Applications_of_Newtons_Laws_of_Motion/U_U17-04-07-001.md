## Question Section 

A flea jumps by exerting a force of (ftimes 10^-5,N) straight down on the ground. A breeze blowing on the flea parallel to the ground exerts a force of(btimes 10^-6,N) on the flea. Find the direction and magnitude of the acceleration of the flea if its mass is(mtimes 10^-7,kg). Do not neglect the gravitational force.
Acceleration:
Directon:ans_rule(40) degrees from the vertical



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
b = randrange(0.45,0.55,0.01)
m = randrange(5.50,6.50,0.01)
Fy = f*(10**(-5)) - m*(10**(-7))*9.8
Fx = b*(10**(-6))
theta = atan((Fx)/(Fy))*180/pi
Ft = sqrt((Fy)**2+(Fx)**2)
A = Ft/(m*(10**(-7)))
