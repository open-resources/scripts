## Question Section 

If a sprinter from the previous problem accelerates at(P1,ms^2) for(20,m), and then maintains that velocity for the remainder of the(100,m) dash, what will be his time for the race?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P1 = randrange(4.1,4.5,0.1)
A1 = sqrt(40*(P1))
P2 = sqrt(40/(P1))
A2 = 80/(A1)
A3 = P2 + A2
