## Question Section 

![Rocket Sled]("Rocket_Sled.png")

What is the magnitude of the deceleration of the rocket sled if it comes to rest in(t,s) from a speed of(v,kmh)? (Such deceleration caused one test subject to black out and have temporary blindness.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(1.0,1.3,0.1)
v = randrange(998,1002,1)
A1 = v/(3.6*(t))
