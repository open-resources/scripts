## Question Section 

![Graph of a function.]("Figure 04_03_03.png")

The net external force on the(m,kg) mower is stated to be(f,N).
(a) If the force of friction opposing the motion is(d,N), what force  (in newtons) is the person exerting on the mower? 
(b) Suppose the mower is moving at(v,ms) when the force  is removed. How far will the mower go before stopping?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(22,25,1)
f = randrange(48,52,1)
d = randrange(22,25,1)
v = randrange(1.3,1.6,0.1)
A1 = f + d
A2 = (d)/(m)
A3 = 0.5*((v)**2)/(A2)
