## Question Section 

![Rocket Sled]("Rocket_Sled.png")

If the rocket sled starts with only one rocket burning, what is its acceleration? Assume that the mass of the system is(2100,kg), and the force of friction opposing the motion is known to be(650,N). The thrust is(T,N). 
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
T = randrange(22000,26000,1000)
A1 = (T-650)/2100
