## Question Section 

Suppose the mass of a fully loaded module in which astronauts take off from the Moon is(masstimes 10^4,kg). The thrust of its engines is(thrusttimes 10^4,N). 
(a) Calculate its acceleration in a vertical takeoff from the Moon
######### T B #########
mc = new_multiple_choice();
mc -> qa("(b) Could it lift off from Earth?", "No");
mc -> makeLast("Yes", "No");
 mc->print_q()
 mc->print_a()

## A
Calculate its acceleration in a vertical takeoff from the Moon
### Answer Section
## B
Could it lift off from Earth?", "No");
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g_moon = 1.67

mass = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1, 1.25, 0.05))
massSI  = mass*10**4
thrust = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3, 3.5, 0.05))
thrustSI = thrust*10**4

A1 = (thrustSI/massSI) - g_moon
