## Question Section 

A powerful motorcycle can produce an acceleration of (a,ms^2) while traveling at(v,kmh). At that speed the forces resisting motion, including friction and air resistance, total(r,N). (Air resistance is analogous to air friction. It always opposes the motion of an object.) What force does the motorcycle exert backward on the ground to produce its acceleration if the mass of the motorcycle with rider is(m,kg)? 
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(88.0,95.0,1)
r = randrange(398,402,1)
m = randrange(240,245,1)
a = randrange(3.45,3.50,0.01)
F = (a)*(m) + r
