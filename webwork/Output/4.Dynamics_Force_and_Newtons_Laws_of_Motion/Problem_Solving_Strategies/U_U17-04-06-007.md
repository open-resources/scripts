## Question Section 

A(m,kg) car pulls a boat on a trailer.
(a) What total force resists the motion of the car, boat, and trailer, if the car exerts a(f,N) force on the road and produces an acceleration of(v,ms^2)? The mass of the boat plus trailer is(b,kg).
(b) What is the force in the hitch between the car and the trailer if(80%) of the resisting forces are experienced by the boat and trailer?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m =randrange(1100,1150,1)
f = randrange(1850,1950,1)
b = randrange(650,750,1)
v = randrange(0.500,0.550,0.001)
A2 = f - (m+b)*v
A3 = b*v+0.8*A2
