## Question Section 

A nurse pushes a cart by exerting a force on the handle at a downward angle(a^circ) below the horizontal. The loaded cart has a mass of(m,kg), and the force of friction is(f,N).  What force must the nurse exert to move at a constant velocity?

## C

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= randrange(25,29,1)
f = randrange(57,63,1)
a = randrange(30,35,1)
A1 = f/(cos(a*pi/180))
