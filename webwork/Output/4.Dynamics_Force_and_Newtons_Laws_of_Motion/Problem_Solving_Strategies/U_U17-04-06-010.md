## Question Section 

![Forces on Car]("Figure_04_06_09.png")

Suppose your car was mired deeply in the mud and you wanted to use the method illustrated above to pull it out. 
(a) What force would you have to exert perpendicular to the center of the rope to produce a force of(f ,N) on the car if the angle is(:2.00^circ)? 
(b) Real ropes stretch under such forces. What force would be exerted on the car if the angle increases to(:7.00^circ) and you still apply the force found in part (a) to its centre?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f = randrange(11500,12500,100)
A1 = 2*f*sin(pi/90)
A2 = A1/(2*sin(7*pi/180))
