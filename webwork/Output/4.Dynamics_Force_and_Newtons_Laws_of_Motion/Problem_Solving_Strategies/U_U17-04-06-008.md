## Question Section 

![Force Vectors]("Figure_04_06_04.png")

Find the magnitudes of the forces(F_1) and(F_2) and  that add to give the total force(:F_tot) shown above. This may be done either graphically or by using trigonometry.  
(F_1: =)
(F_2: =)



## Answer Section

A1 = 20*cos(35*pi/180)
A2 = 20*sin(35*pi/180)
