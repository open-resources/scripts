## Question Section 

![Force on Tooth]("Figure_04_06_07.png")

What force is exerted on the tooth if the tension in the wire is(f,N)? Note that the force applied to the tooth is smaller than the tension in the wire, but this is necessitated by practical considerations of how force can be applied in the mouth.
