## Question Section 

<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> What is the initial acceleration of a rocket that has a mass of(rtimes 10^6,kg) at takeoff, the engines of which produce a thrust of(Ttimes 10^6,N)? Do not neglect gravity.

## G
at takeoff, the engines of which produce a thrust of(Ttimes 10^6,N)? Do not neglect gravity.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1.25,1.75,0.01)
T = randrange(1.75,2.25,0.01)
A1 = (T*(10**(6)) - r*(10**(6))*9.8)/(r*(10**(6)))
