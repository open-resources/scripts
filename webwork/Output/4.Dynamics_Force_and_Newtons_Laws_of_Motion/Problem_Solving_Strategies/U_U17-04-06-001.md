## Question Section 

A(mtimes 10^5,kg) rocket is accelerating straight up. Its engines produce(t times 10^7,N) of thrust, and air resistance is(rtimes 10^6,N) . What is the rocket's acceleration?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.15,0.01))
t = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(1.230,1.260,0.001))
r= sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.26,4.56,0.01))
P1 = t*(10**(7))/(m*(10**(5)))
P2 = r*(10**(6))/(m*(10**(5)))
A1 = P1 - P2 - 9.8
