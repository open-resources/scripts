## Question Section 

Commercial airplanes are sometimes pushed out of the passenger loading area by a tractor. 
(a) An(1800,kg) tractor exerts a force of(ftimes 10^4,N) backward on the pavement, and the system experiences forces resisting motion that total(2400,N). If the acceleration is(a,ms^2), what is the mass of the airplane? 
(b) Calculate the force exerted by the tractor on the airplane, assuming(2200,N) of the friction is experienced by the airplane.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f = randrange(1.70,1.80,0.01)
a = randrange(0.125,0.175,0.001)
A1 = (f*(10**(4))-2400)/(a)-1800
A2 = (A1)*(a) + 2200
