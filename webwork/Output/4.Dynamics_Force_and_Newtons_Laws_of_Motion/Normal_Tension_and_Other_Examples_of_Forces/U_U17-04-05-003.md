## Question Section 

![Tension in Rope]("NU_U17-04-05-003.png")

(a) Calculate the tension in a vertical strand of spider web if a spider of mass(mtimes 10^-5,kg) hangs motionless on it.
 
(b) Calculate the tension in a horizontal strand of spider web if the same spider sits motionless in the middle of it, much like the tightrope walker in the figure below. The strand sags at an angle of(t^circ) below the horizontal. 
Compare this with the tension in Part (a). That is, enter the ratio of the new tension divided by the old tension in the answer slot below.

## A
Calculate the tension in a vertical strand of spider web if a spider of mass(mtimes 10^-5,kg) hangs motionless on it.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
m = randrange(7.95,8.10,0.01)
A1 = m*(10**(-5))*9.8
t = randrange (11.5,12.5,0.1)
d = m*(10**(-5))*9.8/(2*sin(t*pi/180))
A2 = (d)/(A1)
