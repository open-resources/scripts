## Question Section 

What force does a trampoline have to apply to a(45.0,kg) gymnast to accelerate her straight up at(v,ms^2)? Note that the answer is independent of the velocity of the gymnast—she can be moving either up or down, or be stationary.

## G

from random import randrange
v = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
A1 = 45*(v+9.8)
