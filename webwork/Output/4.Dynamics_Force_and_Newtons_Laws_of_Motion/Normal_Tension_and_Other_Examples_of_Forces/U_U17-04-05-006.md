![Baby Weighed with Spring Scale]("Figure_04_05_14.png")

Consider the baby being weighed. 
(a) What is the mass of the child and basket if a scale reading of(f,N) is observed? 
(b) What is the tension in the cord attaching the baby to the scale?
(c) What is the tension  in the cord attaching the scale to the ceiling, if the scale has a mass of(m,kg)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f = randrange(35,55,1)
A1 = f/9.8
A2 = f
m = randrange(0.45,0.55,0.01)
A3 = f + m*9.8
