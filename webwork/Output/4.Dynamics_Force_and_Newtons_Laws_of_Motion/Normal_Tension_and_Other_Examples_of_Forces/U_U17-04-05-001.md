## Question Section 

Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war. Each of the first team's members has an average mass of(t1,kg) and exerts an average force of(f1,N) horizontally. Each of the second team's members has an average mass of(t2,kg) and exerts an average force of(f2,N) horizontally. 
(a) What is the acceleration of the two teams? 
(b) What is the tension in the section of rope between the teams?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
f1 = randrange(1350,1355,1)
f2 = randrange(1360,1365,1)
t1 = randrange(66,69,1)
t2 = randrange(71,74,1)
u = f2 - f1
d = t1 + t2
A1 = (u)/(d)
A2 = 9*(t1)*(A1)+9*(f1)
