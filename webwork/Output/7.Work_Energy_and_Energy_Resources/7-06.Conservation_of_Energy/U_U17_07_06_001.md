## Question Section 

Knowing that(10^-19,J) are required to break one molecule of DNA and that a single electron emitted by a TV tube carries(4.0times 10^-15,J), how many DNA molecules could be broken by the energy carried by a single electron in the beam of an old-fashioned TV tube? (These electrons were not dangerous in themselves, but they did create dangerous X-rays. Later model tube TVs had shielding that absorbed X-rays before they escaped and exposed viewers.)
ans_rule(40) molecules
