## Question Section 

Assuming negligible air resistance, calculate the final speed of a rock thrown from a bridge(h,m) above water with an initial speed of(vo,ms).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

g = 9.80
h = randrange(29,45,2.03)
vo = randrange(12,19,0.7)
vo2 = vo**2
vf = (vo2+2*g*h)**(1/2)
