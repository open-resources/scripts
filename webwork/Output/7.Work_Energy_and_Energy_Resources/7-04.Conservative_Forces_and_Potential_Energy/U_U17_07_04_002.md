## Question Section 

A pogo stick has a spring with a force constant of(2.50times 10^4,Nm), which can be compressed(xcm,cm). To what maximum height can a child jump on the stick using only the energy in the spring, if the child and stick have a total mass of(m,kg)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

k = 2.5*(10**4)
xcm = randrange(11,25,0.57)
x = xcm/100
x2 = x**2
g = 9.80
m = randrange(35,55,2)
h = (k*x2)/(2*m*g)
