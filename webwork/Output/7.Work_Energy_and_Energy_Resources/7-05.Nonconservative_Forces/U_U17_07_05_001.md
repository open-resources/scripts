## Question Section 

A(m,kg) skier with an initial speed of(vo,ms) coasts up a straight slope. The slope makes an angle of(degree^circ) relative to the horizontal, and once the skier reaches the top of the slope her altitude is(h,m) higher than it was at ground level. Find her final speed at the top, given that the coefficient of friction between her skis and the snow is(0.0800).

## C
relative to the horizontal, and once the skier reaches the top of the slope her altitude is(h,m) higher than it was at ground level. Find her final speed at the top, given that the coefficient of friction between her skis and the snow is(0.0800).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(55,75,2)
degree = randrange(34,45,1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
u = 0.0800
vo = randrange(12.01,19,0.23)
vo2 = vo**2
h = randrange(2.5,7,0.43)
g = 9.80
vf = (vo2-2*g*h*(1+(u*cos(rads)/sin(rads))))**(1/2)
