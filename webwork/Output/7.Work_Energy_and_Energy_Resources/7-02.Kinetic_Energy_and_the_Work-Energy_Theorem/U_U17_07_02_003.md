## Question Section 

Calculate the value for the kinetic energy of an aircraft carrier with a weight of(Ntimes 10^9,N), moving at a speed of(v,ms).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

N = randrange(5,9,0.5)
m = N*10**9/9.8
v = randrange(20,35,1)
v2 = v**2
KE = 0.5*m*v2
