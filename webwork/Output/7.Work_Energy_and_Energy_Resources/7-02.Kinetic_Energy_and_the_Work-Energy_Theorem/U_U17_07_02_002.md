## Question Section 

How fast must a(me,kg) elephant move to have the same kinetic energy as a(ms,kg) sprinter running at(v,ms)?

## G
elephant move to have the same kinetic energy as a(ms,ksprinter running at(v,ms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

me = randrange(2000,3000,129)
ms = randrange(65,95,2)
v = randrange(10,30,1)
v2 = v**2
ve = sqrt((ms/me)*v2)
