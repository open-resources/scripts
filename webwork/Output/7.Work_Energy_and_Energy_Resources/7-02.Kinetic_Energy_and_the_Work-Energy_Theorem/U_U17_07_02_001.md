## Question Section 

Compare the kinetic energy of a(m1,kg) truck moving at(v1kmh,kmh) with that of a(m2,kg) astronaut in orbit moving at(v2kmh,kmh).
ans_rule(40)

## G
truck moving at(v1kmh,kmh) with that of a(m2,kastronaut in orbit moving at(v2kmh,kmh).
### Answer Section
## H
with that of a(m2,kg) astronaut in orbit moving at(v2kmh,kmh).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v1kmh = randrange(108,145,3)
v1 = v1kmh*(1000/3600)
v2kmh = randrange(26000,29500,300)
v2 = v2kmh*(1000/3600)
m1 = randrange(20000,30000,1000)
m2 = randrange(75,95,1)
KEtr = 1/2*m1*(v1)**2
KEas = 1/2*m2*(v2)**2
KEtras = KEtr/KEas
