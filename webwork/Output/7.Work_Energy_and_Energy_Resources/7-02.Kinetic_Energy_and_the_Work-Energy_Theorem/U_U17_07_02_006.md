## Question Section 

Boxing gloves are padded to lessen the force of a blow. 
a) Calculate the force exerted by a boxing glove on an opponent's face, if the glove and face compress(dacm,cm) during a blow in which the(m,kg) arm and glove are brought to rest from an initial speed of(v,ms). 
b) Calculate the force exerted by an identical blow in the gory old days when no gloves were used and the knuckles and face would compress only(dbcm,cm).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v = randrange(10.00,19.99,0.13)
v2 = v**2
m = randrange(6.72,9.99,0.13)
dacm = randrange(6.13,9.65,.22)
da = dacm/100
dbcm = randrange(1.79,3.99,0.14)
db = dbcm/100
Fa = m*v2/(2*da)
Fb = m*v2/(2*db)
