## Question Section 

a) Calculate the magnitude of the force needed to bring a(m,kg) car to rest from a speed of(vkmh,kmh) in a distance of(da,m) (a fairly typical distance for a non-panic stop).
b) Suppose instead the car hits a concrete abutment at full speed and is brought to a stop in(db,m). 
Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted on the car and compare it with the force found in part (a).
Second force =
Ratio of second force to first force =ans_rule(40)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

vkmh = randrange(75,99,1)
vo = vkmh*(1000/3600)
vo2 = vo**2
m = randrange(872,999,13)
da = randrange(113,165,2)
db = randrange(1.87,4.99,0.12)
Fa = (m*vo2)/(2*da)
Fb = (m*vo2)/(2*db)
Fba = Fb/Fa
