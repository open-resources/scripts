## Question Section 

A car's bumper is designed to withstand a(4.0,kmh) ((1.12,ms)) collision with an immovable object without damage to the body of the car. The bumper cushions the shock by absorbing the force over a distance that is greater than it would be without the bumper. Calculate the magnitude of the average force on a bumper that collapses(d,m) while bringing a(m,kg) car to rest from an initial speed of(1.12,ms).

## G
car to rest from an initial speed of(1.12,ms).

((1.12,ms)) collision with an immovable object without damage to the body of the car. The bumper cushions the shock by absorbing the force over a distance that is greater than it would be without the bumper. Calculate the magnitude of the average force on a bumper that collapses(d,m) while bringing a(m,kg) car to rest from an initial speed of(1.12,ms).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v1 = 0
vo = 1.12
v2 = vo**2
m = randrange(872,999,13)
d = randrange(.813,.965,.023)
F = ((m*v2)-(m*v1))/(2*d*cos(0))
