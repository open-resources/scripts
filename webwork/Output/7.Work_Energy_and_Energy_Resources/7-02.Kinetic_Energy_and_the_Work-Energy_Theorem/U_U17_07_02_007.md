## Question Section 

Calculate the average force a(m,kg) sprinter exerts on the track to accelerate from(vo,ms) to(v,ms) in a distance of(d,m), if she encounters a headwind that exerts an average force of(Fw,N) against him.

## G
sprinter exerts on the track to accelerate from(vo,ms) to(v,ms) in a distance of(d,m), if she encounters a headwind that exerts an average force of(Fw,N) against him.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(60.72,90.99,1.3)
v = randrange(6.00,9.00,0.13)
v2 = v**2
vo = randrange(2.00,4.00,0.46)
vo2 = vo**2
d = randrange(16.13,29.65,2.2)
Fw = randrange(25,40,1)
F = (m/(2*d))*(v2-vo2)
Fnet = F+Fw
