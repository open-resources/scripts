## Question Section 

Calculate the power output in watts of a shot-putter who takes(t,s) to accelerate the(m-kg) shot from rest to(v,ms), while raising it(h,m). (Do not include the power produced to accelerate his body.)

## G
shot from rest to(v,ms), while raising it(h,m). (Do not include the power produced to accelerate his body.)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(6.2,9.9,0.19)
t = randrange(1.2,3.2,.04)
g = 9.8
h = randrange(0.701,0.999,0.012)
v = randrange(12,15,1)
v2 = v**2
W = 0.5*m*v2+m*g*h
P = W/t
