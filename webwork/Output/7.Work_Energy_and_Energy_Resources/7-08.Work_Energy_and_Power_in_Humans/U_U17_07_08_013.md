## Question Section 

A swimmer exerts an average horizontal backward force of(F,N) with his arm during each(d,m) long stroke. 
a) What is his work output in each stroke? 
b) Calculate the power output of his arms if he does(strokes) strokes per minute.

## A
What is his work output in each stroke? 
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate the power output of his arms if he does(strokes) strokes per minute.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(55,79,2)
d = randrange(1.30,1.75,0.05)
F = randrange(70,90,1)
strokes = randrange(115,135,1)
t = 60
W = F*d
Wmin = strokes*W
P = Wmin/t
