## Question Section 

What is the efficiency of a subject on a treadmill who delivers work at the rate of(Pout,W) while consuming oxygen at the rate of(2.00,Lmin)? (Oxygen consumption of(2.00,Lmin) corresponds to a power output of(700,W).)
ans_rule(40) %



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

Pout = randrange(100,200,7)
Pin = 700
Eff = Pout/Pin
percent = Eff*100
