## Question Section 

a) Calculate the energy used by a(m-kg) woman who does(N) deep knee bends in which her centre of mass is lowered and raised(h,m). You may assume her efficiency is(percent)%. 
b) What is the average power consumption rate in watts if she does this in(min,min)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(55,79,2)
h = randrange(0.30,0.75,0.05)
percent = randrange(20,40,1)
Eff = percent/100
g = 9.8
N = randrange(45,55,1)
Wout = N*m*g*h
Win = Wout/Eff
min = randrange(3,5,0.5)
t = min*60
P = Win/t
