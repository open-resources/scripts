## Question Section 

A car advertisement claims that its(m-kg) car accelerated from rest to(v,ms) and drove(dkm,km), gaining(hkm,km) in altitude, on(1.0,gal) of gasoline ((1.2times 10^8,J)). The average force of friction including air resistance was(Ff,N). Assume all values are known to three significant figures. 
Calculate the car's efficiency.
