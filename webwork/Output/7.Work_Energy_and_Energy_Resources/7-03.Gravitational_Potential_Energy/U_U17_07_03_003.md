## Question Section 

Suppose a(mbg,g) kookaburra (a large kingfisher bird) picks up a(mag,g) snake and raises it(h,m) from the ground to a branch. 
a) How much work did the bird do on the snake?
 
b) How much work did the bird do to raise its own centre of mass to the branch?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

mag = randrange(65,85,1)
ma = mag/1000
mbg = randrange(320,430,15)
mb = mbg/1000
g = 9.80
h = randrange(2.5,4.5,.3)
PEa = ma*g*h
PEb = mb*g*h
