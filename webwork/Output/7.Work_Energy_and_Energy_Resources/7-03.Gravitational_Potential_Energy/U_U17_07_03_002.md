## Question Section 

a) How much gravitational potential energy (relative to the ground on which it is
built) is stored in the Great Pyramid of Cheops, given that its mass is about(7.00times 10^9,kg) and its centre of mass is(h,m) above the surrounding ground? 
 
b) Determine the ratio of this energy to the energy equivalent of the daily food intake of a person. ((1.2times 10^7,J)).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = 7*(10**9)
g = 9.80
h = randrange(25,45,3)
PE = m*g*h
Ef = 1.2*(10**7)
Epf = PE/Ef
