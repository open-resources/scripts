## Question Section 

A(mg,g) toy car is propelled by a compressed spring that starts it moving. The car follows a curved track. What is the final speed if its initial speed is(vo,ms) and it coasts up the frictionless slope, gaining(h,m) in altitude?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

do {
mg = randrange(100,150,2)
m = mg/1000
vo = randrange(1.84,4,.14)
vo2 = vo**2
g = 9.80
h = randrange(0.104,0.359,0.034)
} until (vo2-2*g*h > 0)
vf = (vo2-2*g*h)**(1/2)
