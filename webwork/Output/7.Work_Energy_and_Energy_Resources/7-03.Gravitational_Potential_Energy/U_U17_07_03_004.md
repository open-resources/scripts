## Question Section 

The final speed of a roller coaster that has descended(h,m) is only slightly greater when it has an initial speed of(v,ms) than when it starts from rest. This implies that(DeltaPE >>KE_i) for the roller coaster's motion. Confirm this statement by determining the ratio of(DeltaPE) to(KE_i).
ans_rule(40)

## I
for the roller coaster's motion. Confirm this statement by determining the ratio of(DeltaPE) to(KE_i).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

v = randrange(4,9,1)
v2 = v**2
g = 9.80
h = randrange(25,45,6)
PEKEi = (2*g*h)/v2
