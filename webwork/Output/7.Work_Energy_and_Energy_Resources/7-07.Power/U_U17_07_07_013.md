## Question Section 

Calculate the power output needed for a(m-kg) car to climb a(degree ^circ) slope at a constant(v,ms) while encountering wind resistance and friction totalling(f,N).

## C
slope at a constant(v,ms) while encountering wind resistance and friction totalling(f,N).
### Answer Section
## G
car to climb a(degree ^circ) slope at a constant(v,ms) while encountering wind resistance and friction totalling(f,N).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

f = randrange(500,700,12)
v = randrange(23,40,3.5)
g = 9.80
m = randrange(800,999,42)
degree = randrange(2,5,1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
P = v*(f+m*g*sin(rads))
