## Question Section 

![Crab Nebula.]("NU_U17_07_07_001.png")

The Crab Nebula (pictured above) is the remnant of a supernova that occurred in A.D. 1054. The pulsar within the Crab Nebula has a power output of(10^28,W). The power output of a supernova is(5times 10^37,W) at its peak. Calculate the approximate factor by which the power output of this astronomical object has changed since its explosion.
