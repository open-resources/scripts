## Question Section 

a) Find the useful power output of an elevator motor that lifts a(m1-kg) load a height of(h,m) in(t,s), if it also increases the speed from rest to(v,ms). Note that the total mass of the counterbalanced system is(m2,kg), so that only(m1,kg) is raised in height, but the full(m2,kg) is accelerated. 
b) What does it cost, if electricity is (money) per kW.h?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m1 = randrange(2500,3700,235)
m2 = randrange(10000,20000,492)
v = randrange(3,9,1)
v2 = v**2
h = randrange(30,49,1)
t = randrange(12,25,1)
g = 9.8
PW = (1/t)*(((m2*v2)/2)+m1*g*h)
PkW = PW/1000
money = randrange(0.0300,0.0900,0.0082)
cost = PkW*money
