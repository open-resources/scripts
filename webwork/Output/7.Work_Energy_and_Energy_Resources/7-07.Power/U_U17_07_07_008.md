## Question Section 

A(m,-kg) dragster accelerates from rest to a final speed of(v,ms) in(d,m) and encounters an average frictional force of(f,N). What is its average power output in watts if this takes(t,s)?
What is its average power output in horsepower? (Note that 1 hp = 746 W.)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

m = randrange(500,700,23)
v = randrange(100,200,16)
v2 = v**2
d = randrange(400,600,75)
f = randrange(1200,1500,27)
t = randrange(3.9,9.99,0.18)
P = ((0.5*m*v2)-((-f)*(d)))/t
Php = P/746
