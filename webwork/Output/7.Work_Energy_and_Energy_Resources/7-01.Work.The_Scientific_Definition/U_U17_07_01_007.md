## Question Section 

A shopper pushes a grocery cart(d,m) at constant speed on level ground, against a(F,N) frictional force. He pushes in a direction(degree^circ) below the horizontal. 
a) What is the work done on the cart by friction? 
b) What is the work done on the cart by the gravitational force?
c) What is the work done on the cart by the shopper?
d) Find the force the shopper exerts, using energy considerations
e) What is the total work done on the cart?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

degree = 25
rads = degree*(pi/180)
d180 = 180*(pi/180)
d90 = 90*(pi/180)
F = randrange(32,78,3)
d = randrange(21.14,49.99,2.3)
Wf = F*d*cos(d180)
Wg = F*d*cos(d90)
Ws = abs(Wf)
Fd = Ws/(d*cos(rads))
W = Wf+Ws
