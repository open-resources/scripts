## Question Section 

![Rescue Sled.]("NU_U17_07_01_008.png")

Suppose the ski patrol lowers a rescue sled and victim, having a total mass of(m,kg), down a(degree^circ) slope at constant speed, as shown above. The coefficient of friction between the sled and the snow is(us). 
a) How much work is done by friction as the sled moves(d,m) along the hill? 
b) How much work is done by the rope on the sled in this distance? 
c) What is the work done by the gravitational force on the sled? 
d) What is the total work done?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

degree = randrange(54,68,1)
rads = degree*(pi/180)
d180 = 180*(pi/180)
d0 = 0*(pi/180)
m = randrange(65,99,2)
d = randrange(25,43,2)
us = 1.000
g = 9.80
Wf = us*m*g*cos(rads)*(d*cos(d180))
Wr = m*g*(sin(rads)-(us)*cos(rads))*d*cos(d180)
Wg = m*g*sin(rads)*d*cos(rads)
W = Wf+Wr+Wg
