## Question Section 

Suppose a car travels(km,km) at a speed of(v,ms), and uses(gal,gal) of gasoline. Only(percent, %) of the gasoline goes into useful work by the force that keeps the car moving at constant speed despite friction. (The energy content of gasoline is(1.2times 10^8,Jgal).)
a) What is the force exerted to keep the car moving at constant speed?
b) If the required force is directly proportional to speed, how many gallons of gasoline will be used to drive(km,km) at a speed of(v1,ms)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

km = randrange(125,499,4)
d = km*1000
v = randrange(35.67,59.99,0.82)
gal = randrange(2,6,1)
percent = randrange(29,40,1)
ppercent = percent/100
EnergyContent = 1.2*(10**8)
Wf = gal*EnergyContent*ppercent
Ff = Wf/d
v1 = randrange(20.16,30.99,0.17)
gallons = (v1/v)*gal
