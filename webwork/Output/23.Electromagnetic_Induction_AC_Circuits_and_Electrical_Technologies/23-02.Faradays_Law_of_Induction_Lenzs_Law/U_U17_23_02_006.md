## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b>An MRI technician moves his hand from a region of very low magnetic field strength into an MRI scanner's(strengthSI)(T) field with his fingers pointing in the direction of the field. 
a) Find the average emf induced in his wedding ring, given its diameter is(diameter)(cm) and assuming it takes(timeSI)(s) to move it into the field.
ans_rule(40)(mV)

## A
Find the average emf induced in his wedding ring, given its diameter is(diameter)(cm) and assuming it takes(timeSI)(s) to move it into the field.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mu = 4*pi*10**-7
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
diameter = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.15,2.25,0.01))
timeSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.4f", randrange(0.0095,0.0105,0.0001))
radiusSI = (diameter*10**-2)/2

emfSI = ((strengthSI*pi*((radiusSI)**2))/timeSI)
emfmV = emfSI*10**3
currentSI = (emfSI)/resistanceSI
powerSI = ((currentSI**2)*resistanceSI)
powermW = powerSI*10**3
inducedstrengthSI = Real((mu*currentSI)/(2*radiusSI))
