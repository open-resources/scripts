## Question Section 

<b>
A(radiusSI)(m) radius,(turns)-turn coil is rotated one-fourth of a revolution in(time)(ms) (this is(60)(revs)) originally having its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. Find the magnetic field strength needed to induce an average emf of(emfSI)(V).
ans_rule(40)(T)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
radiusSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
turns = randrange(490,510,1)
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.15,4.25,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3
emfSI = randrange(9750,10250,50)

strengthSI = (emfSI*timeSI)/(areaSI*turns)
