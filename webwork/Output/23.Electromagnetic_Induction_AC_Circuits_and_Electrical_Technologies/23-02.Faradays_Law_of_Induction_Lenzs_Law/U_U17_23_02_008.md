## Question Section 

<b>
An emf is induced by rotating a(turns)-turn,(diameter)(cm) diameter coil in the Earth's(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T) magnetic field. What average emf is induced, given the plane of the coil is originally perpendicular to the Earth's field and is rotated to be parallel to the field in(time)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(900,1100,10)
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
strength = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
strengthSI = strength*10**-5
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
timeSI = time*10**-3

emfSI = (turns*strengthSI*areaSI)/(timeSI)
