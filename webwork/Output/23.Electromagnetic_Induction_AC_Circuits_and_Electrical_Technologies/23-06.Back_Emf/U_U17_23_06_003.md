## Question Section 

<b>
What is the back emf of a(emfSI)(V) motor that draws(current_normalSI)(A) at its normal speed and(current_startingSI)(A) when first starting?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = randrange(110,130,1)
current_startingSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
current_normalSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01))

resistanceSI = emfSI/current_startingSI
backemfSI = emfSI-(current_normalSI*resistanceSI)
