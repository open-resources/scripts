## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> The motor in a toy car is powered by four batteries in series, which produce a total emf of(emfSI)(V). The motor draws(current_runningSI)(A) and develops a(backemfSI)(V) back emf at normal speed. Each battery has a(internal_resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> internal resistance. What is the resistance of the motor?
ans_rule(40) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01))
current_runningSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))
backemfSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.45,4.55,0.01))
internal_resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))

resistanceSI = ((emfSI-backemfSI)/current_runningSI)-(4*internal_resistanceSI)
