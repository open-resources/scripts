## Question Section 

<b>
An American traveler in New Zealand carries a transformer to convert New Zealand's standard(input_voltageSI)(V) to(output_voltageSI)(V) so that she can use some small appliances on her trip.
a) What is the ratio of turns in the primary and secondary coils of her transformer?
ans_rule(40)

## A
What is the ratio of turns in the primary and secondary coils of her transformer?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
input_voltageSI= randrange(230,250,10)
output_voltageSI = 0.5*input_voltageSI

turnsratio = input_voltageSI/output_voltageSI
currentratio = turnsratio**-1
