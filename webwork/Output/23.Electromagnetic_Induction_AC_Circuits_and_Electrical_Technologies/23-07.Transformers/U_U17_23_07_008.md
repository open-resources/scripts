## Question Section 

<b>
A large power plant generates electricity at(generated_voltage)(kV). Its old transformer once converted the voltage to(old_voltage)(kV). The secondary of this transformer is being replaced so that its output can be(new_voltage)(kV) for more efficient cross-country transmission on upgraded transmission lines. The power output is(output_power) (MW) and the line resistance is(resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>.
a) What is the old line loss?
b) What is the new line loss?

## A
What is the old line loss?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the new line loss?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
generated_voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11,13,0.1))
old_voltage = randrange(320,350,5)
old_voltageSI = old_voltage*10**3
new_voltage = randrange(725,775,5)
new_voltageSI = new_voltage*10**3
output_power = randrange(975,1025,5)
output_powerSI = output_power*10**6
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))

old_currentSI = (output_powerSI)/(old_voltageSI)
new_currentSI = (output_powerSI)/(new_voltageSI)

oldpowerlossSI = (old_currentSI**2)*resistanceSI
oldpowerloss = oldpowerlossSI*10**-6
newpowerlossSI = (new_currentSI**2)*resistanceSI
newpowerloss = newpowerlossSI*10**-6
