## Question Section 

<b>
The plug-in transformer for a laptop computer puts out(output_voltageSI)(V) and can supply a maximum current of(output_currentSI)(A). What is the maximum input current if the input voltage is(input_voltageSI)(V)? Assume(100)(%) efficiency.
ans_rule(40)(A)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
output_voltageSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.25,8.25,0.01))
output_currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.75,2.75,0.05))
input_voltageSI= randrange(220,260,2)

input_currentSI = output_currentSI*(output_voltageSI/input_voltageSI)
