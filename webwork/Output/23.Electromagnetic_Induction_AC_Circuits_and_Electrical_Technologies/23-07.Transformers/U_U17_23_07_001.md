## Question Section 

<b>
A plug-in transformer supplies(output_voltageSI)(V) to a video game system.
a) How many turns are in its secondary coil, if its input voltage is(input_voltageSI)(V) and the primary coil has(input_turns) turns?
ans_rule(40) turns

## A
How many turns are in its secondary coil, if its input voltage is(input_voltageSI)(V) and the primary coil has(input_turns) turns?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
output_voltageSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01))
input_voltageSI = randrange(110,130,1)
input_turns = randrange(375,425,5)
output_currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.25,1.35,0.01))

output_turns = input_turns*(output_voltageSI/input_voltageSI)
input_currentSI = output_currentSI*(output_turns/input_turns)
