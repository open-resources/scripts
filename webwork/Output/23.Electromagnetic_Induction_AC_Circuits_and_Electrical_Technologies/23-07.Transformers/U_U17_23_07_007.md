## Question Section 

<b>
A large power plant generates electricity at(generated_voltage)(kV). Its old transformer once converted the voltage to(old_voltage)(kV). The secondary of this transformer is being replaced so that its output can be(new_voltage)(kV) for more efficient cross-country transmission on upgraded transmission lines.
a) What is the ratio of turns in the new secondary compared with the old secondary?
ans_rule(40)

## A
What is the ratio of turns in the new secondary compared with the old secondary?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
generated_voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11,13,0.1))
old_voltage = randrange(320,350,5)
new_voltage = randrange(725,775,5)

turnsratio = new_voltage/old_voltage
currentratio = old_voltage/new_voltage
powerratio = currentratio**2
