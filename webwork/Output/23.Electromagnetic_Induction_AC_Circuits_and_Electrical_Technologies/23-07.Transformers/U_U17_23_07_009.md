## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> The(input_voltage)(kV) AC electricity from a power transmission line is fed into the primary coil of a transformer. The ratio of the number of turns in the secondary to the number in the primary is(fracN_sN_p =(turnsratio).
What voltage is induced in the secondary?
ans_rule(40)(MV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
input_voltage = randrange(320,350,5)
input_voltageSI = input_voltage*10**3
turnsratio = randrange(950,1050,5)

output_voltageSI = input_voltageSI*turnsratio
output_voltage = output_voltageSI*10**-6
