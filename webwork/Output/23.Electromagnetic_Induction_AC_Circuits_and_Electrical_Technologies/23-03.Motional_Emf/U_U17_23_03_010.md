![Tethered Satellite]("NU_U17_23_03_010.png")

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> The Tethered Satellite in the figure above has a mass of(massSI)(kg) and is at the end of a(length)(km) long,(diameter)(mm) diameter steel cable.
a) How much does the cable stretch if a(forceSI)(N) force is exerted to pull the satellite in? (Assume the satellite and shuttle are at the same altitude above the Earth.)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Y = 210*10**9
massSI = randrange(520,530,1)
length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
lengthSI = length*10**3
diameter = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01))
radiusSI = diameter/2000
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
forceSI = randrange(95,105,1)

deltaL = (forceSI*lengthSI)/(areaSI*Y)
K = (forceSI/deltaL)
energySI = 0.5*K*(energy**2)
