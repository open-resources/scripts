## Question Section 

<b>
In the August 1992 space shuttle flight, only(lengthSI)(m) of the conducting tether could be let out. A(emfSI)(V) motional emf was generated in the Earth's(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T) field, while moving at(speedtimes 10^3)(ms). What was the angle between the shuttle's velocity and the Earth's field, assuming the conductor was perpendicular to the field?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
lengthSI = randrange(240,260,1)
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(39.5,40.5,0.1))
strength = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
strengthSI = strength*10**-5
speed = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.75,7.85,0.01))
speedSI = speed*10**3

rads = asin(emfSI/(speedSI*strengthSI*lengthSI))
degrees = rads*180/pi
