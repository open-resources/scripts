## Question Section 

<b>
A nonferrous screwdriver is being used in a(strengthSI)(T) magnetic field. What maximum emf can be induced along its(length)(cm) length when it moves at(speedSI)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1))
lengthSI =length/100
speedSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5.95,6.05,0.01))

emfSI = (velocitySI*strengthSI*lengthSI)
