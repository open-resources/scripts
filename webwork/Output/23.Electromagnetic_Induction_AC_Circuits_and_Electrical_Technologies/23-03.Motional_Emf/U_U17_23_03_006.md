## Question Section 

<b>
A(length)(cm) long rod moves at(speedSI)(ms). What is the strength of the magnetic field if a(emfSI)(V) emf is induced?
ans_rule(40)(T)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(94.5,95.5,0.1))
speedSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01))
length= sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1))
lengthSI = length/100

strengthSI = (emfSI)/(speedSI*lengthSI)
