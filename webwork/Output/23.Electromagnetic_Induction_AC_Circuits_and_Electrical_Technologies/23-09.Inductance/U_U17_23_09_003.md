## Question Section 

<b>
The(currentSI)(A) current through a(inductance)(mH) inductor is switched off in(time)(ms). What is the emf induced opposing this?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01))
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8.45,8.55,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3
inductance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3

emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
