## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> A very large, superconducting solenoid such as one used in MRI scans, stores(energy)(MJ) of energy in its magnetic field when(currentSI)(A) flows.
a) Find its self-inductance.
ans_rule(40)(H)

## A
Find its self-inductance.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
energySI = energy*10**6
currentSI = randrange(90,110,2)
massSI = randrange(975,1025,5)
heatcapSI = randrange(190,210,5)

inductanceSI = (2*energySI)/(currentSI**2)
deltatempSI = (energySI)/(massSI*heatcapSI)
