## Question Section 

<b>
A(inductanceSI)(H) inductor has(currentSI)(A) of current turned off in(time)(ms).
a) What voltage is induced to oppose this?
ans_rule(40)(V)

## A
What voltage is induced to oppose this?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1))
currentSI = randrange(90,110,2)
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3

emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
