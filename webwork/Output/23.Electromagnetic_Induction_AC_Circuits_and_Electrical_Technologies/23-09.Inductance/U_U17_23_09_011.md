## Question Section 

<b>
When the(currentSI)(A) current through an inductor is turned off in(time)(ms), an(emfSI)(V) emf is induced, opposing the change. What is the value of the self-inductance?
ans_rule(40)(mH)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3
emfSI = randrange(775,825,5)

inductanceSI = (emfSI*timeSI)/(currentSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
