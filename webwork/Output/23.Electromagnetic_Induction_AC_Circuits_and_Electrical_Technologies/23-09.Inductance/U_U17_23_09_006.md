## Question Section 

<b>
Camera flashes charge a capacitor to high voltage by switching the current through an inductor on and off rapidly. In what time must the(currentSI)(A) current through a(inductance)(mH) inductor be switched on or off to induce a(emfSI)(V) emf?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
inductance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3
emfSI = randrange(450,550,10)

timeSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/emfSI
