## Question Section 

<b>
If two coils placed next to one another have a mutual inductance of(inductance)(mH), what voltage is induced in one when the(currentSI)(A) current in the other is switched off in(time)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
time = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(29.5,30.5,0.1))
timeSI = time*10**-3
inductance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3

emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
