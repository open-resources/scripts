## Question Section 

<b>
A large research solenoid has a self-inductance of(inductanceSI)(H).
a) What induced emf opposes shutting it off when(currentSI)(A) of current through it is switched off in(time)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(kV)

## A
What induced emf opposes shutting it off when(currentSI)(A) of current through it is switched off in(time)(ms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(24.5,25.5,0.1))
currentSI = randrange(75,125,5)
time = randrange(75,85,1)
timeSI = time*10**-3

emfSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(timeSI)
emf = emfSI*10**-3
energySI = 0.5*inductanceSI*(currentSI**2)
powerSI = (energySI/timeSI)
power = powerSI*10**-6
