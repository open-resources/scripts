## Question Section 

<b>
How fast can the(currentSI)(A) current through a(inductanceSI)(H) inductor be shut off if the induced emf cannot exceed(emfSI)(V)?
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
currentSI = randrange(145,155,1)
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(74.5,75.5,0.1))

timeSI = (inductanceSI*currentSI)/(emfSI)
