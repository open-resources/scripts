## Question Section 

<b>
What capacitance do you need to produce a resonant frequency of(frequency)(GHz), when using an(inductance)(nH) inductor?
ans_rule(40)(pF)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
frequencySI = frequency*10**9
inductance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-9

capacitanceSI = ((inductanceSI)*(2*pi*frequencySI))
capacitance = capacitanceSI*10**12
