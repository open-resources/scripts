### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3
capacitance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(38,42,0.1))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-6

frequencySI = (2*pi*sqrt(inductanceSI*capacitanceSI))
frequency = frequencySI*10**-3
