### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency_a = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(86,90,0.1))
frequency_aSI = frequency_a*10**6
frequency_b = randrange(106,110,1)
frequency_bSI = frequency_b*10**6
capacitance_a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.45,2.55,0.01))
capacitance_aSI = capacitance_a*10**-12

inductanceSI = ((capacitance_aSI)*(2*pi*frequency_aSI)**2)**-1
inductance = inductanceSI*10**6
capacitance_bSI = ((inductanceSI)*(2*pi*frequency_bSI)**2)**-1
capacitance_b = capacitance_bSI*10**12
