## Question Section 

<b>
If you want a characteristic RL time constant of(tauSI)(s), and you have a(resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor, what value of self-inductance is needed?
ans_rule(40)(H)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
tauSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
resistanceSI = randrange(450,550,5)
inductanceSI = tauSI*resistanceSI
