## Question Section 

<b>
Using the exact exponential treatment, find the time required for the current through a(inductanceSI)(H) inductor in series with a(resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor to be reduced to(ratio)(%) of its original value.
ans_rule(40)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.9,2.1,0.01))
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001))
ratio= sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
percent = ratio/100

tauSI = (inductanceSI)/(resistanceSI)
timeSI = (-tauSI)*ln(percent)
