## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you have a supply of inductors ranging from(inductance_low)(nH) to(inductance_highSI)(H), and resistors ranging from(resistance_lowSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> to(resistance_high) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>M&Omega;<span>. What is the range of characteristic RL time constants you can produce by connecting a single resistor to a single inductor?
Low-end:

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance_low = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
inductance_lowSI = inductance_lowSI*10**-9
inductance_highSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
resistance_lowSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
resistance_high = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
resistance_highSI = resistance_high*10**6

tau_lowSI = ((inductance_lowSI)/(resistance_highSI))*10**15
tau_highSI = (inductance_highSI)/(resistance_lowSI)
