## Question Section 

<b>
Use the exact exponential treatment to find how much time is required to bring the current through an(inductance)(mH) inductor in series with a(resistanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span> resistor to(ratio)(%) of its final value, starting from zero.
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(75,85,0.1))
inductanceSI = inductance*10**-3
resistanceSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14.5,15.5,0.1))
ratio= sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(97,99,0.5))
percent = ratio/100

tauSI = (inductanceSI)/(resistanceSI)
timeSI = (-tauSI)*ln(1-percent)
time = timeSI*10**3
