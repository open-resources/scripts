## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> In a recording of voltages due to brain activity (an EEG), a(voltage)(mV) signal with a(frequencySI)(Hz) frequency is applied to a capacitor, producing a current of(current)(mA). Resistance is negligible. What is the capacitance?
ans_rule(40)(F)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
voltageSI = voltage*10**-3
frequencySI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001))
current = randrange(90,110,1)
currentSI = current*10**-3

capacitanceSI = (currentSI)/(2*pi*frequencySI*voltageSI)
