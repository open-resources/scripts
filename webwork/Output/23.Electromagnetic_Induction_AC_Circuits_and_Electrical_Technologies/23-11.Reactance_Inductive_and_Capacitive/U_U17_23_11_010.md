## Question Section 

<b>
A certain type of capacitor is designed to filter low-frequency signals, impeding their transmission between circuits.
a) What capacitance is needed to produce a(reactance_a) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> reactance at a frequency of(frequency_aSI)(Hz)?
ans_rule(40)(nF)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
reactance_a = randrange(90,110,1)
reactance_aSI = reactance_a*10**3
frequency_aSI = randrange(110,130,1)
frequency_b = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
frequency_bSI = frequency_b*10**6

capacitanceSI = (2*pi*frequency_aSI*reactance_aSI)**-1
capacitance = capacitanceSI*10**9
reactance_bSI = (2*pi*frequency_bSI*capacitanceSI)**-1
