## Question Section 

<b>
A(frequencySI)(Hz),(voltageSI)(V) source produces a(current)(mA) current when connected to a capacitor. What is the capacitance?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequencySI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19,21,0.1))
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14,18,0.1))
current = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
currentSI = current*10**-3

capacitanceSI = (currentSI)/(2*pi*voltageSI*frequencySI)
