## Question Section 

<b>
A(frequency)(kHz),(voltageSI)(V) source connected to an inductor produces a(currentSI)(A) current. What is the inductance?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
frequency = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19,21,0.1))
frequencySI = frequency*10**3
voltageSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14,18,0.1))
currentSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))

inductanceSI = (voltageSI)/(2*pi*frequencySI*currentSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**6
