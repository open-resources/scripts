## Question Section 

<b>
At what frequency will an(capacitance)(mF) capacitor have a reactance of(reactanceSI) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>&Omega;<span>?
ans_rule(40)(Hz)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
capacitance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(79.5,80.5,0.1))
capacitanceSI = capacitance*10**-3
reactanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.24,0.26,0.001))

frequencySI = (2*pi*reactanceSI*capacitanceSI)**-1
