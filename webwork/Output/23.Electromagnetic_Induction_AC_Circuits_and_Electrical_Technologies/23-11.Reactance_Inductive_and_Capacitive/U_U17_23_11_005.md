a) Find the current through a(inductanceSI)(H) inductor connected to a(frequency_aSI)(Hz),(voltageSI)(V) AC source.
b) What would the current be at(frequency_b)(kHz)?

## A
Find the current through a(inductanceSI)(H) inductor connected to a(frequency_aSI)(Hz),(voltageSI)(V) AC source.
### Answer Section
## B
What would the current be at(frequency_b)(kHz)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inductanceSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001))
voltageSI = randrange(460,500,2)
frequency_aSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(58,62,0.1))
frequency_b = randrange(95,105,1)
frequency_bSI = frequency_b*10**3

reactance_aSI = 2*pi*frequency_aSI*inductanceSI
reactance_bSI = 2*pi*frequency_bSI*inductanceSI

current_aSI = (voltageSI)/(reactance_aSI)
current_bSI = (voltageSI)/(reactance_bSI)
current_b = current_bSI*10**3
