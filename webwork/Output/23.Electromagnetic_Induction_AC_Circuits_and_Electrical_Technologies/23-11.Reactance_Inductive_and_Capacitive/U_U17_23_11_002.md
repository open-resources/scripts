## Question Section 

<b>
What value of inductance should be used if a(reactance) <span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;<span> reactance is needed at a frequency of(frequencySI)(Hz)?
ans_rule(40)(H)

## E

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
reactance = randrange(15,20,1)
reactanceSI = reactance*10**3
frequencySI = randrange(475,525,5)

inductanceSI = (reactanceSI)/(2*pi*frequencySI)
