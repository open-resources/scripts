### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
reactance_a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01))
reactance_aSI = reactance_a*10**3
frequency_a = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(14,16,0.1))
frequency_aSI = frequency_a*10**3
frequency_bSI = randrange(55,65,0.1)

inductanceSI = (reactance_aSI)/(2*pi*frequency_aSI)
inductance = inductanceSI*10**3
reactance_bSI = 2*pi*inductanceSI*frequency_bSI
