## Question Section 

<b>
At what angular velocity will the peak voltage of a generator be(voltageSI)(V), if its(turns)-turn,(diameter)(cm) diameter coil rotates in a(strengthSI)(T) field?
ans_rule(40)(rpm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltageSI = randrange(470,490,1)
turns = randrange(490,510,1)
diameter = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.240,0.260,0.001))

omega = voltageSI/(turns*areaSI*strengthSI)
rpm = omega*60/(2*pi)
