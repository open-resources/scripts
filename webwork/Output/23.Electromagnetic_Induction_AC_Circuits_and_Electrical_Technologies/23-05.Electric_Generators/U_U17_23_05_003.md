## Question Section 

<b>
What is the peak emf generated by rotating a(turns)-turn,(diameter)(cm) diameter coil in the Earth's(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T) magnetic field, given the plane of the coil is originally perpendicular to the Earth's field and is rotated to be parallel to the field in(time)(ms)?
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(950,1050,10)
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19.5,20.5,0.1))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
strengthSI = strength*10**-5
time = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
timeSI = time*10**-3
omega = (pi/2)/(timeSI)

emfSI = (omega*turns*areaSI*strengthSI)
