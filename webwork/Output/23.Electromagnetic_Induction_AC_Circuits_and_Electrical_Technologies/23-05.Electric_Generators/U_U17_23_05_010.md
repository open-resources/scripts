## Question Section 

<b>
If the emf of a coil rotating in a magnetic field is zero at(t = 0) , and increases to its first peak at(t =)(time)(ms):
a) What is the angular velocity of the coil?
ans_rule(40)(rads)

## A
What is the angular velocity of the coil?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
timeSI = time*10**-3
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)

periodSI = (timeSI)*4
period = periodSI*1000

theta = pi/2
omega = (theta/timeSI)
peak2 = time+period
quarterpeakSI = (1/omega)*asin(1/4)
quarterpeak2SI = (periodSI/2)-quarterpeakSI
