## Question Section 

<b>
What is the peak emf generated by a(radiusSI)(m) radius,(turns)-turn coil is rotated one-fourth of a revolution in(time)(ms), originally having its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field with a strength of(strengthSI)(T).
ans_rule(40)(kV)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(490,510,1)
time = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.15,4.19,0.01))
timeSI = time*10**-3
radiusSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.420,0.430,0.01))
omega = (pi/2)/(timeSI)

emfSI = (omega*turns*areaSI*strengthSI)
emfkV = emfSI*10**-3
