## Question Section 

<b>
A bicycle generator rotates at(omega)(rads), producing an(emfSI)(V) peak emf. It has a(length)(cm) by(width)(cm) rectangular coil in a(strengthSI)(T) field. How many turns are in the coil?
ans_rule(40) turns



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
omega = randrange(1870,1880,1)
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(17.5,18.5,0.1))
length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(0.95,1.05,0.01))
lengthSI = length/100
width = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01))
widthSI = width/100
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.635,0.645,0.001))
areaSI = (lengthSI*widthSI)

turns = emfSI/(omega*areaSI*strengthSI)
