## Question Section 

<b>
A car generator turns at(rpm)(rpm) when the engine is idling. Its(turns)-turn,(length)(cm) by(width)(cm) rectangular coil rotates in an adjustable magnetic field so that it can produce sufficient voltage even at low rpms. What is the field strength needed to produce a(emfSI)(V) peak emf?
ans_rule(40)(T)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
rpm = randrange(390,410,1)
omega = rpm*((2*pi)/60)
turns = randrange(295,305,1)
length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
lengthSI = length/100
width = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01))
widthSI = width/100
emfSI = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(23.5,24.5,0.1))
areaSI = (lengthSI*widthSI)

strengthSI = emfSI/(omega*turns*areaSI)
