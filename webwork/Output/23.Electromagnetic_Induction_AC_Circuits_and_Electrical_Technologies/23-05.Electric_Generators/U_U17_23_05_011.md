## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> A(turns)-turn coil with a(areaSI)(m^2) area is spun in the Earth's(strengthtimes 10^-5)(T) field, producing a(emf)(kV) maximum emf. At what angular velocity must the coil be spun?
ans_rule(40)(rpm)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(490,510,1)
areaSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.245,0.255,0.001))
strength = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01))
strengthSI = strength*10**-5
emf = randrange(11.5,12.5,0.1)
emfSI = emf*10**-3

omega = emfSI/(turns*areaSI*strengthSI)
rpm = omega*(60/(2*pi))
