## Question Section 

<b>
A(turns)-turn,(diameter)(cm) diameter coil rotates at an angular velocity of(omega)(rads) in a(strengthSI)(T) field, starting with the plane of the coil parallel to the field.
a) What is the peak emf?
ans_rule(40)(V)

## A
What is the peak emf?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(70,80,1)
diameter = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1))
radiusSI = diameter/200
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
omega = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01))
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1.20,1.30,0.01))

emfSI = omega*turns*areaSI*strengthSI
F = 0
G =0  #pi/rad_s
periodSI = (2*pi)/omega
