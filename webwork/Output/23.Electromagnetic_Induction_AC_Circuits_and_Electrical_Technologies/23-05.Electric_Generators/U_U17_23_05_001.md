## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the peak voltage of a generator that rotates its(turns)-turn,(diameterSI)(m) diameter coil at(rpm)(rpm) in a(strengthSI)(T) field.
ans_rule(40)(V)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(190,210,5)
diameterSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.095,0.105,0.001))
radiusSI = diameterSI/2
areaSI = pi*(radiusSI**2)
rpm = randrange(3500,3700,10)
strengthSI = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(0.790,0.810,0.001))
omega = rpm*2*pi/60

peakemf= (omega*turns*areaSI*strengthSI)
