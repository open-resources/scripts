## Question Section 

There is relatively little empty space between atoms in solids and liquids, so that the average density of an atom is about the same as matter on a macroscopic scaleâ€”approximately(10^3,(kgm^3)  . The nucleus of an atom has a radius about(10^-15)  that of the atom and contains nearly all the mass of the entire atom. What is the approximate density of a nucleus? b) One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus. What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun (the radius of the Sun is(7times 10^8,(m))? The mass of the sun is equal to(1.99times 10^30,(kg).
(a))
(b))

## B
One remnant of a supernova, called a neutron star, can have the density of a nucleus. What would be the radius of a neutron star with a mass 10 times that of our Sun (the radius of the Sun is(7times 10^8,(m))? The mass of the sun is equal to(1.99times 10^30,(kg).

## Answer Section

A1 = (10)**(18)
A2 = ((3)*(1.99*10**(30))/((4)*(pi)*(A1)))**(1/3)
