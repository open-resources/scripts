## Question Section 

A twin-sized air mattress used for camping has dimensions of(100,(cm) by(200,(cm) by(150,(cm) when blown up. The weight of the mattress is(mass,(kg). How heavy a person could the air mattress hold if it is placed in freshwater? The density of air is(1.21,(kgm^3).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(1,5,0.1)

A1 = (1.21)*(9.8)*(3)-(mass*9.8)
