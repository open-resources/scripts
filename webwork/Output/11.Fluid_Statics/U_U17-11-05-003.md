## Question Section 

A crass host pours the remnants of several bottles of wine into a jug after a party. He then inserts a cork with a(d1,(cm) diameter into the bottle, placing it in direct contact with the wine. He is amazed when he pounds the cork into place and the bottom of the jug (with a(d2,(cm) diameter) breaks away. Calculate the extra force exerted against the bottom if he pounded the cork with a(force,(N) force.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(100,150,1)
d1 = randrange(1,3,0.01)
d2 = randrange(10,15,0.01)

A1 = (((d2)/(d1))**(2))*(force)-force
