## Question Section 

During heavy lifting, a disk between spinal vertebrae is subjected to a(force,(N) compressional force.
a) What pressure is created, assuming that the disk has a uniform circular cross section(r,(cm) in radius?
b) What deformation is produced if the disk is(thick,(cm) thick and has a Young's modulus of(1.5times 10^9,(Nm^2)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(4000,6000.1)
r = randrange(1,4,0.01)
thick = randrange(0.5,1,0.001)

A1 = (force)/((pi)*((r/100)**(2)))
A2 = (A1)*(thick/100)/(1500000000)
