## Question Section 

A submarine is stranded on the bottom of the ocean with its hatch(hatch,(m) below the surface. Calculate the force needed to open the hatch from the inside, given it is circular and(d,(m) in diameter. Air pressure inside the submarine is(1.00,(atm). The density of salt water is(1025,(kgm^3).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
hatch = randrange(20,30,0.1)
d = randrange(0.3,0.5,0.01)
A1 = (hatch)*(1025)*(9.8)*(pi)*((d/2)**(2))
