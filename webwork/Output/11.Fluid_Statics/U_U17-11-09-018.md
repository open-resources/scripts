## Question Section 

You are pumping up a bicycle tire with a hand pump, the piston of which has a(r)(cm) radius. What force in newtons must you exert to create a pressure of(pressuretimes 10^5)(Pa).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1,4,0.01)
pressure = randrange(6,8,0.01)
A1 = (pressure)*(100000)*(pi)*((r/100)**(2))
