## Question Section 

The pressure exerted by a phonograph needle on a record is surprisingly large. If the equivalent of(mass,(g) is supported by a needle, the tip of which is a circle(r,(mm) in radius, what pressure is exerted on the record in  ?

## G
is supported by a needle, the tip of which is a circle(r,(mm) in radius, what pressure is exerted on the record in  ?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(0.9,1.1,0.01)
r = randrange(0.1,0.3,0.001)

a1 = (mass*10**(-3))*(9.8)
a2 = (pi)*((r)*(10)**(-3))**(2)
A1 = a1/a2
