## Question Section 

Water towers store water above the level of consumers for times of heavy use, eliminating the need for high-speed pumps. How high above a user must the water level be to create a gauge pressure of(pressuretimes 10^5,(Nm^2) ?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(2,4,0.01)

A1 =((pressure)/(9.8))*(100)
