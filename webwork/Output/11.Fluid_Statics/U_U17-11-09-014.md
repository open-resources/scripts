## Question Section 

Suppose you hit a steel nail with a(0.500,(kg) hammer, initially moving at(speed,(ms)  and brought to rest in(d,(mm). The surface tension of steel is(2.10times 10^11,(Nm^2).
a) What average force is exerted on the nail?
b) How much is the nail compressed if it is(diameter)(mm) in diameter and(long)(cm) long? 
c) What pressure is created on the(1.00,(mm) diameter tip of the nail?

## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(10,20,0.1)
d = randrange(2,3,0.01)
diameter = randrange(2,3,0.01)
long = randrange(5,7,0.01)

A1 = (0.5)*((speed)**(2))/(2*(d/1000))
A2 = ((1)/(2.1*(10**(11))))*((A1)/((pi)*((diameter/2000)**(2))))*(long/100)
A3 = (A1)/((pi)*((0.0005)**(2)))
