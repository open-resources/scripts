## Question Section 

Calculate the gauge pressures inside(r,(cm) radius bubbles of water, alcohol, and soapy water. The surface tensions of water, alcohol, and soapy water are equal to(0.0728) ,(0.0223) and(0.0370)(Nm^2) respectively. 
Water = 
Alcohol =
Soapy Water =



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1,7,0.01)

A1 = ((4)*(0.0728)/(r))*100
A2 = ((4)*(0.0223)/(r))*100
A3 = ((4)*(0.0370)/(r))*100
