## Question Section 

Pressure cookers have been around for more than 300 years, although their use has strongly declined in recent years (early models had a nasty habit of exploding). How much force must the latches holding the lid onto a pressure cooker be able to withstand if the circular lid is(area,(cm) in diameter and the gauge pressure inside is(pressure,(atm)? Neglect the weight of the lid.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(20,30,0.1)
pressure = randrange(2,4,0.01)

A1 = (pressure)*(101325)*(pi)*(area/200)**(2)
