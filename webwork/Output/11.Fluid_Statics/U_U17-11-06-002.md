## Question Section 

Convert normal blood pressure readings of(P1) over(P2,(mm Hg) to(Nm^2) using the relationship for pressure due to the weight of a fluid ((P = hrho g) )  rather than a conversion factor.(rho = 13.6times 10^3,(kgm^3).
(P)<sub>P1<sub> =
(P)<sub>P2<sub> =

## G
to(Nm^2) using the relationship for pressure due to the weight of a fluid ((P = hrho )  rather than a conversion factor.(rho = 13.6times 10^3,(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P1 = randrange(110,130,1)
P2 = randrange(70,90,1)

A1 = (P1)*(13600)*(9.8)/1000
A2 = (P2)*(13600)*(9.8)/1000
