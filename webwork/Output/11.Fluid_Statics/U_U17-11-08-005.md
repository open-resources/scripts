## Question Section 

![[Figure]]("Figure_12_08_10a.png")

The figure above shows the effect of tube radius on the height to which capillary action can raise a fluid.
 (a) Calculate the height  for water in a glass tube with a radius of(0.900,(cm) a rather large tube like the one on the left. 
(b) What is the radius of the glass tube on the right if it raises water to(4.00(cm)?
