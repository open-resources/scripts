## Question Section 

Logs sometimes float vertically in a lake because one end has become water-logged and denser than the other. What is the average density of a uniform-diameter log that floats with (percent) % of its length above water?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(15,30,0.1)

A1 = (1000)*(1-(percent/100))
