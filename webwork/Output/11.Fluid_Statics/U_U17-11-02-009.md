## Question Section 

What is the density of (18.0) -karat gold that is a mixture of( 18) parts gold,( 5) parts silver, and(1)  part copper? (These values are parts by mass, not volume.) Assume that this is a simple mixture having an average density equal to the weighted densities of its constituents. The density of gold is( 19.32,(gcm^3), silver is( 10.1,(gcm^3) and copper is( 8.8,(gcm^3)



## Answer Section

A1 = (24)/((18/19.32)+(5/10.1)+(1/8.8))
