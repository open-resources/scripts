## Question Section 

A xylem tube is of radius(2.50times 10^-5,(m). Verify that such a tube raises sap less than a meter by finding(h) for it, making the same assumptions that sap's density is(1050,(kgm^3), its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is(0.0728,(Nm).

## H
for it, making the same assumptions that sap's density is(1050,(kgm^3), its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is(0.0728,(Nm).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

A1 = ((2)*(0.0728))/((1050)*(9.8)*(2.50))*(100000)
