## Question Section 

What is the pressure inside an alveolus having a radius of(rtimes10^-4,(m)  if the surface tension of the fluid-lined wall is the same as for soapy water  ((0.0370,(Nm))? You may assume the pressure is the same as that created by a spherical bubble.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(2,5,0.01)

A1 = ((4)*(0.0370)/(r))*(10000)
