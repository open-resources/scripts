## Question Section 

Gauge pressure in the fluid surrounding an infant's brain may rise as high as(mmHg,(mm Hg) ((5) to(12)(mm Hg) is normal), creating an outward force large enough to make the skull grow abnormally large.
a) Calculate this outward force in newtons on each side of an infant's skull if the effective area of each side is(area,(cm^2). 
b) What is the net force acting on the skull?

## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mmHg = randrange(70,90,0.1)
area = randrange(60,90,00.1)

A1 = (mmHg)*(133)*(area)*(1/10000)
A2 = 0
