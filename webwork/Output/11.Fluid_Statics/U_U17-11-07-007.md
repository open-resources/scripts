## Question Section 

Archimedes' principle can be used to calculate the density of a fluid as well as that of a solid. Suppose a chunk of iron with a mass of(mass,(g) in air is found to have an apparent mass of(mass2,(g) when completely submerged in an unknown liquid. 
a) What mass of fluid does the iron displace? 
b) What is the volume of iron, using its density of(7.8,(gcm^3).
c) Calculate the fluid's density.

## A
What mass of fluid does the iron displace? 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the volume of iron, using its density of(7.8,(gcm^3).
### Answer Section
## C
Calculate the fluid's density.
### Answer Section
## G
in air is found to have an apparent mass of(mass2,(when completely submerged in an unknown liquid. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(360,400,0.1)
mass2 = randrange(330,359,0.1)

A1 = mass-mass2 
A2 = mass/7.8
A3 = A1/A2
