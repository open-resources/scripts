## Question Section 

How much force is exerted on one side of an(length,(cm) by(width,(cm) sheet of paper by the atmosphere? Atmospheric pressure is equal to(101125,(Nm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(8,9,0.01)
width = randrange(10,12,0.01)
A1 = (101125)*(length)*(width)*(0.0001)
