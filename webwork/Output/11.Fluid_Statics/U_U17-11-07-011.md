## Question Section 

a) What is the density of a woman who floats in freshwater with(percent) % of her volume above the surface? This could be measured by placing her in a tank with marks on the side to measure how much water she displaces when floating and when held under water (briefly).
b) What percent of her volume is above the surface when she floats in seawater? The density of sea water is(1025,(kgm^3)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(2,10,0.1)

A1 = ((1)-(percent)/100)*1000
A2 = (1-((A1)/(1025)))*100
