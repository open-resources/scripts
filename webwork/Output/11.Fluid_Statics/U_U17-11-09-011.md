## Question Section 

When a person sits erect, increasing the vertical position of their brain by(h,(cm), the heart must continue to pump blood to the brain at the same rate. The density of blood is equal to(1050,(kgm^3). 
a) What is the gain in gravitational potential energy for(V,(mL) of blood raised(h,(cm)?
 
b) What is the drop in pressure, neglecting any losses due to friction?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = randrange(30,40,0.1)
V = randrange(90,110,0.1)

A1 = (1050)*((V)*((1/100)**(3)))*(9.8)*(h/100)
A2 = (1050)*(9.8)*(h/100)
