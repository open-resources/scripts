## Question Section 

Nail tips exert tremendous pressures when they are hit by hammers because they exert a large force over a small area. What force must be exerted on a nail with a circular tip of(1.00,(mm) diameter to create a pressure of(pressuretimes 10^9,(Nm^2) (This high pressure is possible because the hammer striking the nail is brought to rest in such a short distance.)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(2,4,0.01)

A1 = (pressure)*(pi)*(0.5)**(2)*1000
