## Question Section 

If the gauge pressure inside a rubber balloon with a(r,(cm) radius is(P,(cm) of water, what is the effective surface tension of the balloon? There are(98.1,(Nm^2)per(1.0,(cm) of H<sub>2<sub>O.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(5,20,0.1)
P = randrange(10,30,0.1)

A1 = (1/4)*(r/100)*(P)*(98.1)
