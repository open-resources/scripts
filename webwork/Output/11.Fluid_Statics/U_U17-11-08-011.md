## Question Section 

Calculate the contact angle for olive oil if capillary action raises it to a height of(h,(cm) in a glass tube with a radius of(0.1,(mm). The density of olive oil is(920,(kgm^3) and the surface tension is(0.032,(Nm).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = randrange(6,8,0.01)
a1 = ((h)*(9.2)*(9.8)*(1))/(2*(0.032)*(10000))
A1 = acos(a1*(pi/180))
