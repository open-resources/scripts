## Question Section 

a) Calculate the buoyant force on a(volume,(L) helium balloon. The density of air is(1.29,(kgm^3)
 
b) Given the mass of the rubber in the balloon is(mass,(g), what is the net vertical force on the balloon if it is let go? You can neglect the volume of the rubber. The density of helium is(0.180,(gL).

## A

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(1,2,0.01)
volume = randrange(1.5,2.5,0.01)

A1 = (1.29)*(9.8)*(volume/1000)
A2 = A1 - (mass + (volume)*(0.180))*(9.8)/1000
