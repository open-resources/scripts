a) Calculate his volume.
b) Find the buoyant force air exerts on him.
c) What is the ratio of the buoyant force to his weight?
ans_rule(40)

## A
Calculate his volume.
### Answer Section
## B
Find the buoyant force air exerts on him.
### Answer Section
## C
What is the ratio of the buoyant force to his weight?

## G
and a density of(density,(kgm^3)  (excluding the air in his lungs). The density of air is(1.29,(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(70,90,0.1)
density = randrange(900,1000,1)
A1 = mass/density
A2 = (A1)*(1.29)*(9.8)
A3 = (A2)/((mass)*(9.8))
