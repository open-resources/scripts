## Question Section 

The aqueous humor in a person's eye is exerting a force of(Force,(N)on the(area,(cm^2)  area of the cornea. What pressure is this in(mm Hg)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(1,1.3,0.01)
Force = randrange(0.2,0.4,0.01)
A1 = ((Force)/(area))*(10000)/(133.3)
