## Question Section 

What force must be exerted on the master cylinder of a hydraulic lift to support the weight of a(weight,(kg) car (a large car) resting on the slave cylinder? The master cylinder has a(d1,(cm) diameter and the slave has a(d2,(cm) diameter.

## G
car (a large car) resting on the slave cylinder? The master cylinder has a(d1,(cm) diameter and the slave has a(d2,(cm) diameter.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
weight = randrange(1700,2200,1)
d1 = randrange(1,5,0.01)
d2 = randrange(20,30,0.1)

A1 = (((d1)/(2))**(2))/(((d2)/(2))**(2))*(weight)*(9.8)
