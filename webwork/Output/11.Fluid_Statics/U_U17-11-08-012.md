## Question Section 

When two soap bubbles touch, the larger is inflated by the smaller until they form a single bubble. The surface tension for soap is(0.0370,(Nm).
a) What is the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble with a(r,(cm) radius?
b) Inside a(r2,(cm) radius soap bubble?
c) Inside the single bubble they form if no air is lost when they touch?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(1,3,0.01)
r2 = randrange(3.01,5,0.01)

A1 = (4)*(0.0370)/(r/100)
A2 = (4)*(0.0370)/(r2/100)
A3 = (4)*(0.0370)/((((r/100)**(3))+((r2/100)**(3)))**(1/3))
