## Question Section 

The left side of the heart creates a pressure of(pressure,(mm Hg) by exerting a force directly on the blood over an effective area of(area,(cm^2). What force does it exert to accomplish this?(1,(atm) =(1.01325times 10^5,(Nm^2) =(760,(mm Hg).
ans_rule(40)(N)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(100,150,1)
area = randrange(10,20,0.1)
A1 = (pressure)*(area)*((101325)/(760))*(1/10000)
