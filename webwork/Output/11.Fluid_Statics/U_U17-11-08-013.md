## Question Section 

Calculate the ratio of the heights to which water and mercury are raised by capillary action in the same glass tube. The surface tension of water is equal to(0.0728,(Nm). The surface tension of mercury is equal to(0.465,(Nm). The density of mercury is equal to(13600,(kgm^3). The contact angle for mercury is(140) degrees.
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

a = cos(140*pi/180)
A1 = ((0.0728)*(1)*(13600))/((0.465)*(a)*(1000))
