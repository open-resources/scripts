## Question Section 

As a woman walks, her entire weight is momentarily placed on one heel of her high-heeled shoes. Calculate the pressure exerted on the floor by the heel if it has an area of(area,(cm^3)  and the woman's mass is(mass,(kg). Express the pressure in(Pa) where(1,(Pa) =(1,(Nm^2).  (In the early days of commercial flight, women were not allowed to wear high-heeled shoes because aircraft floors were too thin to withstand such large pressures.)

## A
where(1,(P=(1,(Nm^2).  (In the early days of commercial flight, women were not allowed to wear high-heeled shoes because aircraft floors were too thin to withstand such large pressures.)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(50,60,0.1)
area = randrange(1.3,1.7,0.01)

A1 = mass*(9.8/area)*10000
