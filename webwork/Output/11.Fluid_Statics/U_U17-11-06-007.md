## Question Section 

Assuming bicycle tires are perfectly flexible and support the weight of bicycle and rider by pressure alone, calculate the total area of the tires in contact with the ground. The bicycle plus rider has a mass of(mass,(kg), and the gauge pressure in the tires is (3.50times 10^5,(Pa).



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(60,100,1)

A1 = (mass)*(9.8)/(350000)
