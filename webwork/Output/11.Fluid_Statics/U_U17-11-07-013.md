## Question Section 

A simple compass can be made by placing a small bar magnet on a cork floating in water. 
a) What fraction of a plain cork will be submerged when floating in water? The density of cork is(240,(kgm^3).
ans_rule(40)
b)  If the cork has a mass of(mass1,(g) and a(mass2,(g) magnet is placed on it, what fraction of the cork will be submerged? Iron has a density of(7.8,(gcm^3).
ans_rule(40)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass1 = randrange(8,12,0.1)
mass2 = randrange(17,22,0.1)

A1 = 0.24
A2 = ((mass1)+(mass2))/(((mass1)/(0.24))+((mass2)/(7.8)))
