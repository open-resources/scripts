## Question Section 

A straightforward method of finding the density of an object is to measure its mass and then measure its volume by submerging it in a graduated cylinder. What is the density of a(mass,(g) rock that displaces(volume,(cm^3) of water? (Note that the accuracy and practical applications of this technique are more limited than a variety of others that are based on Archimedes' principle.)

## G
rock that displaces(volume,(cm^3) of water? (Note that the accuracy and practical applications of this technique are more limited than a variety of others that are based on Archimedes' principle.)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
mass = randrange(200,300,0.1)
volume = randrange(60,100,0.1)

A1 = mass/volume
