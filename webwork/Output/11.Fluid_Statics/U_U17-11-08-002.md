## Question Section 

The pressure inside an alveolus with a(rtimes10^-4,(m) radius is(pressuretimes10^3,(Pa) , due to its fluid-lined walls. Assuming the alveolus acts like a spherical bubble, what is the surface tension of the fluid?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pressure = randrange(1,3,0.01)
r = randrange(1,3,0.01)
A1 = (pressure)*(r)/40
