## Question Section 

Calculate the average pressure exerted on the palm of a shot-putter's hand by the shot if the area of contact is(area,(cm^2)and he exerts a force of(force,(N) on it. Express the pressure in(textNm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
area = randrange(40,60,0.1)
force = randrange(700,900,1)

A1 = (force)/((area)*(0.0001))
