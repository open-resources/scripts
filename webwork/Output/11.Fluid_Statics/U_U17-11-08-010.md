## Question Section 

Suppose water is raised by capillary action to a height of(r,(cm) in a glass tube.
a) To what height will it be raised in a paraffin tube of the same radius? The paraffin tube has an angle of(107) degrees.
 
b) In a silver tube of the same radius? The silver tube has an angle of(90) degrees.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
r = randrange(3,8,0.01)

A1 = (cos(107*(pi/180)))*(r)
A2 = 0
