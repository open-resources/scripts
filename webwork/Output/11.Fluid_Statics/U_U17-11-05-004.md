## Question Section 

A certain hydraulic system is designed to exert a force(force) times as large as the one put into it.
a) What must be the ratio of the area of the slave cylinder to the area of the master cylinder?
ans_rule(40) 
b) What must be the ratio of their diameters?
ans_rule(40) 
c) By what factor is the distance through which the output force moves reduced relative to the distance through which the input force moves? Assume no losses to friction.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
force = randrange(50,200,1)

A1 = force
A2 = sqrt(force)
A3 = 1/(force)
