## Question Section 

A well-thrown ball is caught in a well-padded mitt. If the acceleration of the ball has magnitude(decelerationtimes 10^4,ms^2), and(time,ms) elapses from the time the ball first touches the mitt until it stops, what was the initial speed of the ball?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(1.5,2,0.01)
deceleration = randrange(2,2.5,0.01)

A1 = (time)*(deceleration)*(10)
