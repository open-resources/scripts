## Question Section 

A steel ball is dropped onto a hard floor from a height of(d,(m) and rebounds to a height of(u,(m).
a) Calculate its downward velocity just before it strikes the floor.
b) Calculate its upward velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up.

## A
Calculate its downward velocity just before it strikes the floor.
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate its upward velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1.5,1.56,0.01)
u = randrange(1.43,1.47,0.01)

A1 = sqrt(19.6*d)
A2 = sqrt(19.6*u)
