## Question Section 

a) Calculate the height of a cliff if it takes(t,(s) for a rock to hit the ground when it is thrown straight up from the cliff with an initial velocity of(v,(ms).
b) How long would it take to reach the ground if it is thrown straight down with the same speed?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
t = randrange(2,3,0.01)
v = randrange(7,9,0.01)

A1 = -((v)*(t)+(-0.5)*(9.8)*((t)**(2)))
A2 = ((v)-(sqrt(((v)**(2))+(2)*(9.8)*(A1))))/(-9.8)
