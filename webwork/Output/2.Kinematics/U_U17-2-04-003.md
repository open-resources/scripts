## Question Section 

A commuter backs her car out of her garage with an acceleration of(acceleration,ms^2).
a) How long does it take her to reach a speed of(speed,ms)? 
b) If she then brakes to a stop in(time,s), what is her acceleration?

## A
How long does it take her to reach a speed of(speed,ms)? 
### Answer Section
## B
If she then brakes to a stop in(time,s), what is her acceleration?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
acceleration = randrange(1,2,0.01)
time = randrange(0.6,1,0.01)
speed = randrange(1.5,3,0.01)


A1 = (speed)/(acceleration)
A2 = (speed)/(time)
