## Question Section 

A powerful motorcycle can accelerate from rest to(speed,(ms) in only(time,(s).
a) What is its average acceleration?
b) How far does it travel in that time?

## A
What is its average acceleration?
### Answer Section
## B
How far does it travel in that time?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(25,30,0.1)
time = randrange(3,4.5,0.01)

A1 = (speed)/(time)
A2 = (0.5)*(speed)*(time)
