## Question Section 

A very strong, but inept, shot putter puts the shot straight up vertically with an initial velocity of(v,(ms). How long does he have to get out of the way if the shot was released at a height of(d,(m), and he is(2,(m) tall?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(10,12,0.01)
d = randrange(2,2.5,0.01)
A1 = ((-v)-(sqrt(((v)**(2))+(2)*(9.8)*(d-2))))/(-9.8)
