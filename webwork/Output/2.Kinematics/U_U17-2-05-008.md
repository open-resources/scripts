## Question Section 

In a slap shot, a hockey player accelerates the puck from a velocity of(speed1,(ms) to(speed2,(ms) in the same direction. If this shot takes(timetimes 10^-2,(s), calculate the distance over which the puck accelerates.



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed1 = randrange(6,9,0.01)
speed2 = randrange(35,45,0.01)
time = randrange(3,4,0.01)

A1 = (0.5)*(speed1+speed2)*(time)*(0.01)
