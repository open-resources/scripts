## Question Section 

A football quarterback runs(d1,m) straight down the playing field in(t1,s). He is then hit and pushed(d2,m) straight backward in(t2,s). He breaks the tackle and runs straight forward another(d3,m) in(t3,s). Calculate his average velocity (a) for each of the three intervals and (b) for the entire motion.
a)
(v_1) =
(v_2) =
(v_3) =
b)
(v) =

## A
for each of the three intervals and (b) for the entire motion.
### Answer Section
## B
for the entire motion.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d1 = randrange(12,17,0.1)
d2 = randrange(2,4,0.1)
d3 = randrange(17,25,0.1)
t1 = randrange(2,3,0.1)
t2 = randrange(1,2,0.1)
t3 = randrange(5,6,0.1)

A1 = (d1)/(t1)
A2 = -(d2)/(t2)
A3 = (d3)/(t3)

A4 = (d1-d2+d3)/(t1+t2+t3)
