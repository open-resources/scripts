## Question Section 

A basketball referee tosses the ball straight up for the starting tip-off. At what velocity must a basketball player leave the ground to rise(d,(m) above the floor in an attempt to get the ball?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1,1.5,0.01)

A1 = sqrt((-2)*(-9.8)*(d))
