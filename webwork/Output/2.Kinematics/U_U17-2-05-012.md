## Question Section 

A swan on a lake gets airborne by flapping its wings and running on top of the water. 
a) If the swan must reach a velocity of(speed,(ms) to take off and it accelerates from rest at an average rate of(a,(ms^2), how far will it travel before becoming airborne? 
ans_rule(40) 
b) How long does this take?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(4,8,0.01)
a = randrange(0.3,0.4,0.01)

A1 = ((speed)**(2))/((2)*(a))
A2 = (speed)/(a)
