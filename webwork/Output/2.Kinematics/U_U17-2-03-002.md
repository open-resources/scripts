## Question Section 

A helicopter blade spins at exactly(revs) revolutions per minute. Its tip is(length,m) from the centre of rotation.
a)  Calculate the average speed of the blade tip in the helicopter's frame of reference.
b) What is its average velocity over one revolution?

## A
 Calculate the average speed of the blade tip in the helicopter's frame of reference.
### Answer Section
## B
What is its average velocity over one revolution?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
revs = randrange(50,200,1)
length = randrange(2,9,0.1)

A1 = ((2)*(pi)*(length))/(60/revs)
A2 = 0
