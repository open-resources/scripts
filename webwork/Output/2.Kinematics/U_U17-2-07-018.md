## Question Section 

A soft tennis ball is dropped onto a hard floor from a height of(d,(m) and rebounds to a height of(d2,(m).
a) Calculate its downward velocity just before it strikes the floor. 
b) Calculate its upward velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up.

## A
Calculate its downward velocity just before it strikes the floor. 
### Answer Section
## B
Calculate its upward velocity just after it leaves the floor on its way back up.
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1.2,2,0.01)
d2 = randrange(0.8,1.2,0.01)
A1 = sqrt((2)*(9.8)*(d))
A2 = sqrt((2)*(9.8)*(d2))
