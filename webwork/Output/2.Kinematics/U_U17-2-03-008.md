## Question Section 

The speed of propagation of the action potential (an electrical signal) in a nerve cell depends (inversely) on the diameter of the axon (nerve fiber). If the nerve cell connecting the spinal cord to your feet is(length,m) long, and the nerve impulse speed is(speed,ms), how long does it take for the nerve signal to travel this distance?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(0.9,1.2,0.01)
speed = randrange(15,20,0.1)

A1 = (length)/(speed)
