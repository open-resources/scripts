## Question Section 

A swimmer bounces straight up from a diving board and falls feet first into a pool. She starts with a velocity of(v,(ms), and her takeoff point is(d,(m) above the pool. 
a) How long are her feet in the air? 
b) What is her highest point above the board?
c) What is the magnitude of her velocity when her feet hit the water?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(3,5,0.01)
d = randrange(1.5,2,0.01)

A1 = ((v)+(sqrt(((v)**(2))+(2)*(9.8)*(d))))/(9.8)
A2 = ((v)**(2))/((2)*(9.8))
A3 = sqrt(((v)**(2))+(2)*(9.8)*(d))
