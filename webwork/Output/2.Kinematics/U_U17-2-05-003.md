## Question Section 

A bullet in a gun is accelerated from the firing chamber to the end of the barrel at an average rate of(accelerationtimes 10^5,(ms^2) for(timetimes 10^-4,(s). What is its muzzle velocity (that is, its final velocity)?



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
time = randrange(7,9,0.01)
acceleration = randrange(5,7,0.01)

A1 = (time)*(acceleration)*(10)
