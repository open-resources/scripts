## Question Section 

In 1967, New Zealander Burt Munro set the world record for an Indian motorcycle, on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, of(183.58,(mih) ((82.068,(ms)). The one-way course was(5.00,(mi) long ((8050,(m)). Acceleration rates are often described by the time it takes to reach(60.0,(mih) ((26.8,(ms)) from rest. If this time was(4.00,(s), and Burt accelerated at this rate until he reached his maximum speed, how long did it take Burt to complete the course?
