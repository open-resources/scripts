## Question Section 

An express train passes through a station. It enters with an initial velocity of(v,(ms) and decelerates at a rate of(a,(ms^2) as it goes through. The station is(200,(m) long.
a) How long is the nose of the train in the station?
b) How fast is it going when the nose leaves the station?

## A
How long is the nose of the train in the station?
### Answer Section
## B
How fast is it going when the nose leaves the station?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(18,24,0.1)
a = randrange(0.1,0.3,0.01)

A1 = ((-v)+sqrt(((v)**(2))+((2)*(-a)*(200))))/(-a)
A2 = sqrt(((v)**(2))+((2)*(-a)*(200)))
