## Question Section 

<b>
The left ventricle of a resting adult's heart pumps blood at a flow rate of(Q)(cm^3)(s), increasing its pressure by(PmmHg)(mm Hg), its speed from zero to(vcm)(cms), and its height by(hcm)(cm). (All numbers are averaged over the entire heartbeat). Calculate the total power output of the left ventricle. Note that most of the power is used to increase blood pressure.
ans_rule(40)(W)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Q = randrange(80,90,1)
p = 1050
PmmHg = randrange(100,130,1)
P = PmmHg*133
vcm = randrange(30,40,1)
v = vcm/100
hcm = randrange(4,7,1)
h = hcm/100
g = 9.80
pv = 1/2*p*(v**2)
pgh = p*g*h
power = Q*(P+pv+pgh)*(1*10**-6)
