## Question Section 

<b>
A sump pump (used to drain water from the basement of houses built below the water
table) is draining a flooded basement at the rate of(QLs)(Ls), with an output pressure of(P1ptimes 10^5)(Nm^2). 
a) The water enters a hose with a(d1)-(cm) inside diameter and rises(ha)(m) above the pump. What is its pressure at this point? 
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)
