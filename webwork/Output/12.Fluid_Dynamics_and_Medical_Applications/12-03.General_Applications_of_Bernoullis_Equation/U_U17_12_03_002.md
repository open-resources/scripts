## Question Section 

<b>
A frequently quoted rule of thumb in aircraft design is that wings should produce about(P)(N) of lift per square meter of wing. (The fact that a wing has a top and bottom surface does not double its area). 
a) At takeoff, an aircraft travels at(va)(ms), so that the air speed relative to the bottom of the wing is(va)(ms). Taking the sea level density of air to be(p)(kgm^3), how fast must it move over the upper surface to create the ideal lift?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P = 1000
p = sprintf("%0.2f",1.20)
va = randrange(50,65,1)
vb = randrange(230,265,1)
Ppa = 2000/p
Ppb = 2000/(p/4)
v2a = (Ppa+(va**2))**(1/2)
v2b = (Ppb+(vb**2))**(1/2)
