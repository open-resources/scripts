### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
p = 1000
n = 1.002*(10**-3)
rcmhose = randrange(0.800,0.900,0.011)
rhose = (rcmhose/100)
Ahose = pi*(rhose**2)
rcmnozzle = randrange(0.200,0.300,0.021)
rnozzle = (rcmnozzle/100)
Anozzle = pi*(rnozzle**2)
QLs = sprintf("%0.3f",0.500)
Q = QLs*10**-3
vhose = Q/Ahose
vnozzle = Q/Anozzle
NRhose = (2*p*vhose*rhose)/n
NRnozzle = (2*p*vnozzle*rnozzle)/n
