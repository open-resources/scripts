## Question Section 

<b>
Gasoline is piped underground from refineries to major users. The flow rate is(3.00times 10^-2)(m^3)(s) (about(500)(galmin)), the viscosity of gasoline is(1.00times 10^-3)(Pa) &middot;(s), and its density is(p)(kgm^3).
 
a) What minimum diameter must the pipe have if the Reynolds number is to be less than(2000)? 
ans_rule(40)(m)

## A
&middot;(s), and its density is(p)(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

p = 680
Q = 3*(10**-2)
n = 1*(10**-3)
d = (p*Q)/(500*pi*n)
P = (8*n*Q)/(pi*(d/2)**4)*1000     #Factor of 1000 to convert from Pa/m -> Pa/km.
