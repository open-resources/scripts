## Question Section 

<b>
Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of being
carried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is(QLmin)(Lmin) through a(l)-(m)-long,(dcm)-(cm) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is(pressuretimes 10^6)(Nm^2). Verify that the flow of concrete is laminar taking concrete's viscosity to be(n)(Pa) &middot;(s), and given its density is(density)(Nm^2).
ans_rule(40) < 2000

## A
&middot;(s), and given its density is(density)(Nm^2).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
l = randrange(45,60,1)
dcm = randrange(7,9,1)
r = (dcm/100)*(1/2)
A = pi*(r**2)
QLmin = randrange(200,250,1)
Q = (QLmin*(10**-3))/60
pressure = randrange(6,8,1)
n = sprintf("%0.1f",48)
density = 2300
v = Q/A

v = (Q)/(A)
NR =(2*density*v*r)/(n)
