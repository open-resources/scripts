## Question Section 

<b>
Assuming that blood is an ideal fluid, calculate the critical flow rate at which turbulence is a certainty in the aorta. Take the diameter of the aorta to be(dcm)(cm). (Turbulence will actually occur at lower average flow rates, because blood is not an ideal fluid. Furthermore, since blood flow pulses, turbulence may occur during only the high-velocity part of each heartbeat).
ans_rule(40)(m^3)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
p = 1050
dcm = randrange(2.11,2.75,0.02)
r = (dcm/100)*(1/2)
n = 2.084*(10**-3)
NR = 3000
Q = (pi*r*n*NR)/(2*p)
