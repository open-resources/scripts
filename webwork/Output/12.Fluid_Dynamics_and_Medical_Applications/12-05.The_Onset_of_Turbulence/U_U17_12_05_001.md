## Question Section 

<b>
Verify that the flow of oil is laminar (barely) for an oil gusher that shoots crude oil
(y)(m) into the air through a pipe with a(d)-(m) diameter. The vertical pipe is(l)(m) long. Take the density of the oil to be(pkgm^3) and its viscosity to be(1.00)(Pa) &middot;(s).
ans_rule(40) < 2000

## A
&middot;(s).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

l = 50
d = 0.100
r = (d/2)
y = 25
g = 9.80
p = 900
vo = sqrt(2*g*y)
NR = (2*p*vo*r)/1.00
