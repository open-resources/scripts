## Question Section 

<b>
What is the greatest average speed of blood flow at(37 ^circC) in an artery of radius(rmm)(mm) if laminar flow is a certainty? What is the corresponding flow rate? Take the density of blood to be(p)(kgm^3).
ans_rule(40)(Ls)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
rmm = randrange(2,3,0.11)
r = rmm*(10**-3)
n = 2.084*(10**-3)
NR = 2000
p = 1050
v = (NR*n)/(2*p*r)
Q = (pi*(r**2)*v)*1000
