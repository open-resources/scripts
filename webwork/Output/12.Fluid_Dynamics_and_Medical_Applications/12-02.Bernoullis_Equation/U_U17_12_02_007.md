### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d1 = randrange(7,9,1)
r1 = (d1/2)*(1/100)
A1 = pi*(r1**2)
d2 = randrange(2,4,1)
r2 = (d2/2)*(1/100)
A2 = pi*(r2**2)
QLs = randrange(30,40,1)
Q = QLs*(10**-3)
v1 = Q/A1
v2 = Q/A2
p = 1000
P1P2 = Real(0.5*p*((v2**2)-(v1**2)))
g = 9.80
h = (v2**2)/(2*g)
