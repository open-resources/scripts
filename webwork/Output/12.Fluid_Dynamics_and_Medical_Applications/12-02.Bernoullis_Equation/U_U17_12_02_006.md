## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the approximate force on a square meter of sail, given the horizontal velocity of the wind is(v2)(ms) parallel to its front surface and(v1)(ms) along its back surface. Take the density of air to be(p)(kgm^3). 
The calculation, based on Bernoulli's principle, is approximate due to the effects of turbulence.
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v1 = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(2.5,3.75,0.01))
v2 = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,7,1))
A = randrange(200,340,1)
p = 1.29
F = 1/2*p*((v2**2)-(v1**2))
