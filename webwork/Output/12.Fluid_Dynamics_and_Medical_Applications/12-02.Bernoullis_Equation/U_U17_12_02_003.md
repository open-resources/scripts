## Question Section 

<b>
If the pressure reading of your pitot tube is(P1)(mm Hg) at a speed of(v1kmh)(kmh), what will it be at(v2kmh)(kmh) at the same altitude? Take the outside air temperature to be(0 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(mm Hg)

## G
at a speed of(v1kmh)(kmh), what will it be at(v2kmh)(kmh) at the same altitude? Take the outside air temperature to be(0 ^circC).
### Answer Section
## H
at the same altitude? Take the outside air temperature to be(0 ^circC).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P1 = randrange(10,17,1)
v1kmh = randrange(200,340,1)
v1 = v1kmh*(1000/3600)
v2kmh = randrange(700,840,1)
v2 = v2kmh*(1000/3600)
p = 1.29
P2Nm = (P1*133)+(1/2*p*((v1**2)-(v2**2)))
P2 = P2Nm/133.322
