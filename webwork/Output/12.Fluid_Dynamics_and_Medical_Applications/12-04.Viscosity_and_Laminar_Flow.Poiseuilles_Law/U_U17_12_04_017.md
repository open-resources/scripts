## Question Section 

<b>
During a marathon race, a runner's blood flow increases to(inc) times her resting rate. Her blood's viscosity has dropped to(percent)(%) of its normal value, and the blood pressure difference across the circulatory system has increased by(50.0)(%). By what factor has the average radii of her blood vessels increased?
ans_rule(40)(r)

## C
times her resting rate. Her blood's viscosity has dropped to(percent)(%) of its normal value, and the blood pressure difference across the circulatory system has increased by(50.0)(%). By what factor has the average radii of her blood vessels increased?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
inc = randrange(10,20,1)
percent = randrange(90,99,1)
r2 = ((inc*(percent/100))/1.50)**(1/4)
