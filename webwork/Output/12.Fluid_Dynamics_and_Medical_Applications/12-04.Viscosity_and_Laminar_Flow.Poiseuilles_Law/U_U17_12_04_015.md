## Question Section 

<b>
An intravenous (IV) system having a needle of radius(R)(mm) and length(L)(cm) supplies saline solution to a patient whose blood is at a gauge pressure of(p1)(mm Hg).
a) What pressure difference is created at a depth of(ha)(m) in a saline solution, assuming its density is that of sea water?
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

p = 1025
ha = 1.61
g = 9.8
P2 = p*ha*g
L = sprintf("%0.2f",2.5)
l = L*0.01
R = sprintf("%0.3f",0.15)
r = R*(10**-3)
n = 1.005*(10**-3)
p1 = sprintf("%0.2f",8)
P1 = p1*133.322
P21 = p*1.5*g
Qb = (((P21-P1)*pi*(r**4))/(8*n*l))*(1*(10**6))
h = (P1/(p*g))*100
