## Question Section 

<b>
An oil gusher shoots crude oil(x)(m) into the air through a pipe with a(d)-(m) diameter. Neglecting air resistance but not the resistance of the pipe, and assuming laminar flow, calculate the pressure at the bottom of the(h)-(m)-long vertical pipe. Take the density of the oil to be(p)(kgm^3) and its viscosity to be(1.00Nm^2) (or(Pa) &middot;(s)). Note that you must take into account the pressure due to the(h)-(m) column of oil in the pipe. 
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)

## A
&middot;(s)). Note that you must take into account the pressure due to the(h)-(m) column of oil in the pipe.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
pi = (2143/22)**(1/4)
p = 900
g = 9.8
h = randrange(50,60,1)
deltaP = p*g*h                  #Gauge pressure is zero at pipe opening.
x = randrange(25,30,1)
v = (2*g*x)**(1/2)
d = randrange(0.1,0.130,0.001)
r = d/2
A = pi*(r**2)
SA = pi*(r**4)
Q = A*v
P2 = (8*h*Q)/SA
P = deltaP+P2
