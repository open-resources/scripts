## Question Section 

<b>
What force is needed to pull one microscope slide over another at a speed of(vcm)(cms), if there is a(Lmm)-(mm)-thick layer of(20 ^circC) water between them and the contact area is(Acm)(cm^2)?
ans_rule(40)(N)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
vcm = randrange(1,2,0.03)
v = vcm/100
Lmm = randrange(0.4,0.5,0.004)
L = Lmm*(10**-3)
Acm =randrange(7,9,1)
A = Acm*(10**-4)
n = 1.002*(10**-3)
F = n*((v*A)/L)
