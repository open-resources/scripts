## Question Section 

<b>
When physicians diagnose arterial blockages, they quote the reduction in flow rate. If
the flow rate in an artery has been reduced to(10.0)(%) of its normal value by a blood
clot and the average pressure difference has increased by(20.0)(%), by what factor has
the clot reduced the radius of the artery?
ans_rule(40)(r)



## Answer Section

r2 = (0.1/1.2)**(1/4)
