## Question Section 

<b>
The pressure drop along a length of artery is(P)(Pa), the radius is(rmm)(mm), and the flow is laminar. The average speed of the blood is(vmm)(mms). 
a) What is the net force on the blood in this section of artery? 
ans_rule(40)(N)

## A
What is the net force on the blood in this section of artery? 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
P = randrange(100,130,1)
rmm = randrange(10,15,1)
r = (rmm*(10**-3))**2
vmm = randrange(15,20,1)
v = vmm*(10**-3)
F = P*r*pi
Pb = F*v*1000
