## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a blood vessel's radius is decreased to(percent)(%) of its original value by plaque deposits and the body compensates by increasing the pressure difference along the vessel to keep the flow rate constant.
 
By what factor must the pressure difference increase?
ans_rule(40)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(80,99,1)
P2P1 = 1/((percent/100)**(4))
