## Question Section 

<b>
Concrete is pumped from a cement mixer to the place it is being laid, instead of being
carried in wheelbarrows. The flow rate is(QLmin)(Lmin) through a(l)-(m)-long,(dcm)-(cm) diameter hose, and the pressure at the pump is(pressuretimes 10^6 Nm^2). 
a) Calculate the resistance of the hose. 
ans_rule(40)(N) &middot;(sm^2)

## A
Calculate the resistance of the hose. 
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
l = randrange(45,60,1)
dcm = randrange(7,9,1)
r = (dcm/100)*(1/2)
SA = pi*(r**4)
QLmin = randrange(200,250,1)
Q = (QLmin*(10**-3))/60
pressure = randrange(6,8,1)
P2 = pressure*(10**6)
R = P2/Q
n = (R*SA)/(8*l)
power = P2*Q
