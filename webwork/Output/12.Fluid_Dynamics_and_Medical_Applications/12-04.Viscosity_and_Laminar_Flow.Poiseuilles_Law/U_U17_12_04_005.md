## Question Section 

<b>
A small artery has a length of(Latimes 10^-3)(m) and a radius of(ratimes 10^-5)(m). If the pressure drop across the artery is(kPa)(kPa), what is the flow rate through the artery? Assume that the temperature is(37 ^circC).
ans_rule(40)(mm^3)(s)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
La = randrange(1.1,1.76,0.02)
L = La*(10**-3)
ra = randrange(2.1,2.75,0.01)
V = pi*(ra*(10**-5))**4
kPa = randrange(1.1,1.7,0.1)
P = kPa*(10**3)
n = 2.084*(10**-3)
Q = ((P*V)/(8*n*L))*(1*(10**9))
