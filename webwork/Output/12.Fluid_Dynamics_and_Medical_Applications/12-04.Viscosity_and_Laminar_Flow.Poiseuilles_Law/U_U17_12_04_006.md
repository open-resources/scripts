## Question Section 

<b>
Fluid originally flows through a tube at a rate of(Q)(cm^3)(s). To illustrate the sensitivity of flow rate to various factors, calculate the new flow rate for the following changes with all other factors remaining the same as in the original conditions.
a) Pressure difference increases by a factor of(1.50). 
(s)
b) A new fluid with(3.00) times greater viscosity is substituted. 
(s)
c) The tube is replaced by one having(4.00) times the length.
(s)
d) Another tube is used with a radius(0.100) times the original. 
(s)
e) Yet another tube is substituted with a radius(0.100) times the original and half the length, and the pressure difference is increased by a factor of(1.50).
(s)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

Q = 100
a = Q*1.5
b = Q/3
c = Q/4
d = Q*((0.1)**4)
e = Q*((0.1)**4)*((0.5)**-1)*1.5
