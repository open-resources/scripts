## Question Section 

<b>
The main uptake air duct of a forced air gas heater is(d)(m) in diameter. What is the average speed of air in the duct if it carries a volume equal to that of the house's interior every(min)(min)? 
The inside volume of the house is equivalent to a rectangular solid(w)(m) wide by(l)(m) long by(h)(m) high.
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(0.301,0.715,0.012)
r = (d/2)**2
A = pi*r
min = randrange(12,17,1)
t = min*60
w = randrange(12,15,1)
l = randrange(20,26,1)
h = randrange(1.57,3.24,0.09)
Q = (w*l*h)/t
v = Q/A
