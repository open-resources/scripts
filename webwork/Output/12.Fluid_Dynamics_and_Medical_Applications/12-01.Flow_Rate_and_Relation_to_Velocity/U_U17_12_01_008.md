## Question Section 

<b>
The human circulation system has approximately(1.00times 10^9) capillary vessels. Each vessel has a diameter of about(8.0times 10^-6)(m). Assuming cardiac output is(Lmin)(Lmin), determine the average velocity of blood flow through each capillary vessel.
ans_rule(40)(cms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lmin = randrange(3,6,1)
Q = (Lmin*1000)/60
A = (10**9)*pi*(4*10**-4)**2
v = Q/A
