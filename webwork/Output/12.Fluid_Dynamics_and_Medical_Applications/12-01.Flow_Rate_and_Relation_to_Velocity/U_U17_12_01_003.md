## Question Section 

<b>
Blood is pumped from the heart at a rate of(Vt)(Lmin) into the aorta (of radius(r)(cm)). 
Determine the speed of blood through the aorta.
ans_rule(40)(cms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Vt = randrange(3,9,1)
Q = (Vt*1000)/60
r = randrange(1,2,1)
A = pi*(r**2)
v = Q/A
