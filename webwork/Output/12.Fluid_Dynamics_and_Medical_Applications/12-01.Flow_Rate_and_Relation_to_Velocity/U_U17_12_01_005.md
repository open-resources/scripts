![Waikato River]("NU_U17_12_01_005.png")

<b>
The Huka Falls on the Waikato River is one of New Zealand's most visited natural tourist attractions. On average the river has a flow rate of about(QLs1times 10^5)(Ls). At the gorge, the river narrows to(wa)(m) wide and averages(da)(m) deep.
a) What is the average speed of the river in the gorge? 
b) What is the average speed of the water in the river downstream of the falls when it widens to(wb)(m) and its depth increases to an average of(db)(m)?

## A
What is the average speed of the river in the gorge? 
### Answer Section
## B
What is the average speed of the water in the river downstream of the falls when it widens to(wb)(m) and its depth increases to an average of(db)(m)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

da = 20
wa = 20
db = 40
wb = 60
Aa = (da)*(wa)
Ab = (db)*(wb)
QLs1 = sprintf("%0.1f",3)
Q = (QLs1*10**5)*(1/1000)

va = Q/Aa
vb = Q/Ab
