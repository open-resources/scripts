## Question Section 

<b>
a) As blood passes through the capillary bed in an organ, the capillaries join to form venules (small veins). If the blood speed increases by a factor of(v) and the total cross-sectional area of the venules is(A2)(cm^2), what is the total cross-sectional area of the capillaries feeding these venules?
ans_rule(40)(cm^2)

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(2,5,1)
A2 = randrange(10,15,1)
A1 = v*A2
N = A1/(pi*((5*(10**-4))**2))
