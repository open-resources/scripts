## Question Section 

<b>
Water is moving at a velocity of(v)(ms) through a hose with an internal diameter of(d)(cm). 
a) What is the flow rate in litres per second?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(1.20,3.15,0.07)
r = (d*(1/2)*(1/100))**2
A = pi*r
v = randrange(2,6,1)
v2 = randrange(12,16,1)
Q = (A*v)*1000
d2 = d*((v/v2)**(1/2))
