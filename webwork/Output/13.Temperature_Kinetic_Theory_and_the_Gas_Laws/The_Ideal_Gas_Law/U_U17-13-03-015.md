## Question Section 

<b>
Calculate the depth to which Avogadro's number of table tennis balls would cover Earth. Each ball has a diameter of(3.75)(cm). Assume the space between balls adds an extra(25.0)(%) to their volume and assume they are not crushed by their own weight. Take the radius of the Earth to be(6.376times 10^6)(m).
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

b = ((1.875*(10**(-2)))**(3))
c = (6.376*(10**(6)))**(3)

A1 = (((1.250)*(6.02*(10**(23)))*(b)+(c))**(1/3))-((6.376*(10**(6))))
