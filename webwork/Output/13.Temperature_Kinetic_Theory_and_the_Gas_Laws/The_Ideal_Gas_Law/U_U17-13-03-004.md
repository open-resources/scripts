## Question Section 

<b>
Large helium-filled balloons are used to lift scientific equipment to high altitudes.
a) What is the pressure inside such a balloon if it starts out at sea level with a temperature of(temp^circC) and rises to an altitude where its volume is twenty times the original volume and its temperature is(-temp2^circC)? 
ans_rule(40)(atm)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(5,20,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(40,50,0.1)
A1 = (101300)*(-temp2+273.15)/((20)*(temp+273.15))/(101300)
A2 = (A1)-(1)
