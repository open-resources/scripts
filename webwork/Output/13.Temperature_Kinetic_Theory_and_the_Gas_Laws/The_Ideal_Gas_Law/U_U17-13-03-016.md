### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(20,30,0.1)
volume = randrange(25,40,0.1)
volume2 = randrange(1,2,0.01)
mol = randrange(2,5,0.01)

A1 = (mol)*(0.0821)*(temp+273.15)/(volume)-1
a1 = (1)*(volume2)/((0.0821)*(temp+273.15))
A2 = (a1+mol)*(0.0821)*(temp+273.15)/(volume)-1
