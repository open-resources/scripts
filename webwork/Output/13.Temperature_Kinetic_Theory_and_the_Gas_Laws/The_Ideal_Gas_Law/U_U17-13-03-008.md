## Question Section 

<b>
An airplane passenger has(volume)(cm^3) of air in his stomach just before the plane takes off from a sea-level airport. What volume will the air have at cruising altitude if cabin pressure drops to(pressuretimes 10^4)(Nm^2)?
ans_rule(40)(cm^3)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
volume = randrange(50,200,1)
pressure = randrange(6,9,0.01)

A1 = (10.1300)*(volume)/(pressure)
