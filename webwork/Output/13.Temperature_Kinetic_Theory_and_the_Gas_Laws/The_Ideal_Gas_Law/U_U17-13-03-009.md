## Question Section 

<b>
Use(6.02times 10^23) as Avogadro's number.
a) What is the volume of Avogadro's number of sand grains if each grain is a cube and has sides that are(Lc)(mm) long? 
b) How many kilometers of beaches in length would this cover if the beach averages(Lb)(m) in width and(Db)(m) in depth? Neglect air spaces between grains.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
Lc = sprintf("%0.2f",randrange(1,1.2,0.01))
Na = 6.02*10**23

Vc = ((Lc)*0.001)**3
Vtotal = (Vc)*(Na)

Lb = randrange(90,100,0.1)
Db = randrange(10,15,0.1)
Areab = (Lb)*(Db)

Ltotal = ((Vtotal)/(Areab))*0.001
