## Question Section 

<b>
The gauge pressure in your car tires is(pressureg1times 10^5)(Nm^2) at a temperature of(temp1^circC)  when you drive it onto a ferry boat to Alaska. What is their gauge pressure later, when their temperature has dropped to(temp2^circC) ?
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp1 = randrange(30,40,0.1)
temp1K = temp1+273.15
temp2 = randrange(20,40,0.1)
temp2K = temp2+273.15
pressureg1 = randrange(2,3,0.01)
pressureg1a = pressureg1*10**5
pressureatm = 1.013*10**5
A1 = ((pressureg1a)+(pressureatm))*((temp2K)/(temp1K))-(pressureatm)
