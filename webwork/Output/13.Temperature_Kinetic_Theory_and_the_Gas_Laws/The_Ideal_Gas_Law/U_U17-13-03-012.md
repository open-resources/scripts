## Question Section 

<b>
A bicycle tire has a pressure of(pressuretimes 10^5)(Nm^2) at a temperature of (temp^circC) and contains(volume)(L) of gas. What will its pressure be if you let out an amount of air that has a volume of(100)(cm^3) at atmospheric pressure? Assume tire temperature and volume remain constant.
ans_rule(40)(Pa)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(15,20,0.1)
pressure = randrange(5,9,0.01)
volume = randrange(1,4,0.01)
b1 = ((pressure)*(volume)/((1.38)*(temp+273.15)))*(10**(25))
b2 = ((1.10300)/((1.38)*(temp+273.15)))*(10**(24))
A1 = (b1-b2)*(1.38*(10**(-23)))*(temp+273.15)/(volume*(10**(-3)))
