## Question Section 

<b>
An expensive vacuum system can achieve a pressure as low as(pressuretimes 10^-7)(Nm^2)  at(temp^circC). How many atoms are there in a cubic centimeter at this pressure and temperature? Take the Boltzmann constant to be(k)(_b) =(1.38times 10^-23)(JK).
ans_rule(40)(atomscm^3)

## B
=(1.38times 10^-23)(JK).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(15,30,0.1)
pressure = randrange(1,2,0.01)

A1 = (pressure*(10**(-7)))*(1*(10**(-6)))/((1.38*(10**(-23)))*(temp+273.15))
