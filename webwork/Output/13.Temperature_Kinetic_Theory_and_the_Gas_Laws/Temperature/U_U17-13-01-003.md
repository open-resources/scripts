## Question Section 

<b>
To conserve energy, room temperatures are kept at roughly(temp1^circF) in the winter and(temp2^circF) in the summer. What are these temperatures on the Celsius scale?
T<sub>Winter<sub> =ans_rule(20)(^circC)
T<sub>Summer<sub> =ans_rule(20)(^circC)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp1 = randrange(67,69,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(77,79,0.1)

A1 = (5/9)*(temp1-32)
A2 = (5/9)*(temp2-32)
