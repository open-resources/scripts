## Question Section 

<b>
How much taller does the Eiffel Tower become at the end of a day when the temperature has increased by(temp^circC)? Its original height is(321)(m) and you can assume it is made of steel. The thermal coefficient of steel is(1.2times 10^-5)(^circC^-1).
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(10,20,0.1)

A1 = (1.2*10**(-5))*(321)*(temp)
