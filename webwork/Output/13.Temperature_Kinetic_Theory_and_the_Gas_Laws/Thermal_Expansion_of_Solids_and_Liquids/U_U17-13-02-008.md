## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose a meter stick made of steel and one made of invar (an alloy of iron and nickel) are the same length at(0^circC). What is their difference in length at(temp^circC)? The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is(1.2times 10^-5)(^circC^-1) and for invar is(9.0times 10^-7)(^circC^-1).
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(20,30,0.1)

A1 = ((1.2*(10**(-5)))-(9.0*(10**(-7))))*(1)*(temp)
