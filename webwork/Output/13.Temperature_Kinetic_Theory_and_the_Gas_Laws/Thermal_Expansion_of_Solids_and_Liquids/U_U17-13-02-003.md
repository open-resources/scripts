## Question Section 

<b>
What is the change in length of a(length)-(cm)-long column of mercury if its temperature changes from(temp^circC) to(temp2^circC), assuming the mercury is unconstrained? The thermal coefficient of expansion of mercury is equal to(6.0times 10^-5)(^circC^-1)
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
length = randrange(2,5,0.01)
temp = randrange(35,37,0.1)
temp2 = randrange(39,41,0.1)

A1 = (length/100)*(6.0/100000)*(temp2-temp)
