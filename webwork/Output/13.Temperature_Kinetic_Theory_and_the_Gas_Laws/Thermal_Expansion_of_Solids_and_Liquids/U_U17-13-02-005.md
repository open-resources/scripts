## Question Section 

<b>
You are looking to purchase a small piece of land in Hong Kong. The price is “only” (60,000) per square meter! The land title says the dimensions are(ltimes w)(m). By how much would the total price change if you measured the parcel with a steel tape measure on a day when the temperature was(temp^circC) above normal? The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is(1.2times 10^-5)(C^-1).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

temp = randrange(15,25,0.1)
w = randrange(25,35,0.1)
l = randrange(15,25,0.1)
a = (l)-(temp)*(l)*(1.2/100000)
b = (w)-(temp)*(w)*(1.2/100000)
A1 = ((l)*(w)-(a)*(b))*(60000)
