## Question Section 

<b>
The density of water at(0 ^circC) is very nearly(densitywater)(kgm^3), whereas the density of ice at(0 ^circC) is(densityice)(kgm^3). Calculate the pressure necessary to keep ice from expanding when it freezes, neglecting the effect such a large pressure would have on the freezing temperature. (This problem gives you only an indication of how large the forces associated with freezing water might be).
ans_rule(40)(Nm^2)



## Answer Section

densityice = 917
densitywater = 1000
Vi = 1
Vf = ((densitywater)/(densityice))*(Vi)
deltaV = ((Vf)-(Vi))
beta = 2.2*10**9                                                #Bulk modulus of water.
A1 = ((deltaV)/(Vi))*(beta)
