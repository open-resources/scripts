## Question Section 

<b>
How large an expansion gap should be left between steel railroad rails if they may reach a maximum temperature(temp^circC) greater than when they were laid? Their original length is(length)(m). The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel is equal to(1.2times 10^-5)(^circC^-1).
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(30,40,0.1)
length = randrange(8,14,0.01)
A1 = (1.2/100000)*(temp)*(length)
