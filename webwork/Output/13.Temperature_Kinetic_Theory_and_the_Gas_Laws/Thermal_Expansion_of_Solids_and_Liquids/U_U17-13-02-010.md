## Question Section 

<b>
Most automobiles have a coolant reservoir to catch radiator fluid that may overflow when the engine is hot. A radiator is made of copper and is filled to its(Vi)-(L) capacity when at(temp1^circC). What volume of radiator fluid will overflow when the radiator and fluid reach their(temp2^circC) operating temperature, given that the fluid's volume coefficient of expansion is(beta1fluidtimes 10^-6)(^circC^-1)?
ans_rule(40)(L)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp1 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(5,15,0.1))
temp2 = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(82,94,0.1))
Vi = sprintf("%0.1f",randrange(10,11.5,0.1))
beta1fluid = randrange(400,410,1)
beta2fluid = beta1fluid*10**-6
betacopper = 51*10**-6

deltaV = (Vi)*((temp2)-(temp1))*(beta2fluid-betacopper)
