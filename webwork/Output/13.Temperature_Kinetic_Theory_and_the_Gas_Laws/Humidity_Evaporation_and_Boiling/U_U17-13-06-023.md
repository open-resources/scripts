## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> The temperature inside a supernova explosion is said to be(temptimes 10^13)(K). What would the average velocity of hydrogen atoms be? The molar mass of a supernova is equal to(Mgtimes 10^-3)(kgmol).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(1,6,0.01)
tempc = temp*10**13
Mg = 1.008
Mkg = Mg*0.001
R = 8.314

velocity = sqrt((3*R*tempc)/Mkg)
