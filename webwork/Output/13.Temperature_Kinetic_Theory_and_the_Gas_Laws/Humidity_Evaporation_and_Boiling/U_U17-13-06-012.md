## Question Section 

<b>
If the relative humidity is(percent)(%) on a muggy summer morning when the temperature is(temp1^circC), what will it be later in the day when the temperature is(temp2^circC), assuming the water vapor density remains constant? The saturated vapor density at(20^circC) is equal to(17.2)(gm^3) and the saturated vapor density at(30^circC) is equal to(30.4)(gm^3).
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(70,95,0.1)
temp1 = 20
temp2 = 30

A1 = (percent)*(17.2/30.4)
