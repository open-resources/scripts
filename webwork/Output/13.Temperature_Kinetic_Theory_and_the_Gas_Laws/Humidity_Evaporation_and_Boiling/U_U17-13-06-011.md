## Question Section 

<b>
Air in human lungs has a temperature of(temp^circC) and a saturation vapor density of(44.0)(gm^3).
a) If(volume)(L) of air is exhaled and very dry air inhaled, what is the maximum loss of water vapor by the person?

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(35,40,0.01)
volume = randrange(1,5,0.01)

A1 = (44)*(volume/1000)
A2 = (44)*(8.314)*(temp+273.15)/(18.02)
