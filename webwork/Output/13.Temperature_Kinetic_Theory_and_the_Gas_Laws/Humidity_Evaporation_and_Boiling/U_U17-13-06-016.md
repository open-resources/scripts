## Question Section 

<b>
On a certain day, the temperature is(25^circC) and the relative humidity is(percent)(%). How many grams of water must condense out of each cubic meter of air if the temperature falls to(15^circC)? Such a drop in temperature can, thus, produce heavy dew or fog.
ans_rule(40)(gm^3)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(70,95,0.1)

A1 = (percent)*(23)/(100)-12.8
