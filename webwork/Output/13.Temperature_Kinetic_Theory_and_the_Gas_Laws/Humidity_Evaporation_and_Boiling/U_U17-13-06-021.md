## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> How many moles per cubic meter of an ideal gas are there at a pressure of(pressuretimes 10^14)(Nm^2) and at(temp^circC)? 
ans_rule(40)(molm^3)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(0,50,0.1)
pressure = randrange(1,9,0.01)

A1 = ((pressure)*(10**(14)))/((8.314)*(temp+273.15))
