## Question Section 

<b>
Late on an autumn day, the relative humidity is(percent)(%) and the temperature is(temp1^circC). What will the relative humidity be that evening when the temperature has dropped to(temp2^circC), assuming constant water vapor density? The saturated vapor density at(temp1^circC) is equal to(17.2)(gm^3) and the saturated vapor density at(temp2^circC) is equal to(9.40)(gm^3).
ans_rule(40)(%)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
percent = randrange(30,60,0.1)
temp1 = 20
temp2 = 10

A1 = (percent)*(17.2/9.4)
