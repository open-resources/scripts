## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> To get an idea of the small effect that temperature has on Archimedes' principle, calculate the fraction of a copper block's weight that is supported by the buoyant force in(0^circC) water and compare this fraction with the fraction supported in(temp^circC). The coefficient of volume expansion for copper is equal to(5.1times 10^-5)(^circC^-1) and the coefficient of volume expansion for water is equal to(2.10times 10^-4)(^circC^-1). The density of copper is(8800)(kgm^3). The weight of the copper block can be treated as(1.00)(N) for simplicity.
a) Buoyant Force at(0^circC) =ans_rule(20)

## A
Buoyant Force at(0^circC) =ans_rule(20)
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(60,100,0.1)

A1 = (1000)/(8800)
A2 = (1000)*(1+((5.1*(10**(-5)))*(temp)))/((8800)*(1+((2.10*(10**(-4)))*(temp))))
A3 = (A1)/(A2)
