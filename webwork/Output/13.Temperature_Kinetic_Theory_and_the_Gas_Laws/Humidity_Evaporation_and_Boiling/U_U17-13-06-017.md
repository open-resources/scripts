## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Integrated Concepts:<b> The boiling point of water increases with depth because pressure increases with depth. At what depth will fresh water have a boiling point of(temp^circC) , if the surface of the water is at sea level? The vapor pressure at(temp^circC) is(4.76times 10^5)(Nm^2) and use(1.01times 10^5)(Nm^2) as the normal atmospheric pressure.
ans_rule(40)(m)



## Answer Section

temp = 150

A1 = ((4.76)-(1.01))/((0.01)*(9.8))
