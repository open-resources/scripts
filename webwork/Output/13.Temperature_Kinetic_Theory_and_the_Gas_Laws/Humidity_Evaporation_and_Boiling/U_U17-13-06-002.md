## Question Section 

<b>
a) The vapour pressure of water at(temp ^circC) is equal to(2330)(Pa). What percent of atmospheric pressure does this constitute? Atmospheric pressure is equal to(101,325)(Pa).
b) What percent of(temp ^circC) air is water vapor if it has(100)(%) relative humidity? The density of dry air at(temp ^circC) is(1.20)(kgm^3) and the saturation vapor density of water at(temp ^circC) is equal to(0.0172)(kgm^3).

## A
The vapour pressure of water at(temp ^circC) is equal to(2330)(Pa). What percent of atmospheric pressure does this constitute? Atmospheric pressure is equal to(101,325)(Pa).
### Answer Section
## B
What percent of(temp ^circC) air is water vapor if it has(100)(%) relative humidity? The density of dry air at(temp ^circC) is(1.20)(kgm^3) and the saturation vapor density of water at(temp ^circC) is equal to(0.0172)(kgm^3).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

temp = 20

A1 = 2330/(101325)*100
A2 = (0.0172)/(1.20)*100
