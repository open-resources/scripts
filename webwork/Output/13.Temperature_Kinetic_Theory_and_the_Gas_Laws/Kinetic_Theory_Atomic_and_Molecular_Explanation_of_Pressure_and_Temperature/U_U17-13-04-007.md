## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose that the average velocity of carbon dioxide molecules having molecular mass is equal to(4.401times 10^-2)(kgmol) in a flame is found to be(velocitytimes 10^5)(ms). What temperature does this represent?
ans_rule(40)(K)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
velocity = randrange(1,3,0.01)
velocityc = velocity*10**5
Mg = 44.01
Mkg = (Mg)*0.001
R = 8.314
temp = (Mkg*(velocityc)**2)/(3*R)
