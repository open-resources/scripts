## Question Section 

<b>
Some incandescent light bulbs are filled with argon gas. What is v<sub>rms<sub> for argon atoms near the filament, assuming their temperature is(temp)(K)? Argon has a molar mass of(3.995times 10^-2)(kgmol).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(2000,3000,1)

A1 = sqrt((3)*(1.38*(10**(-23)))*(temp)/((39.95*(10**(-3)))/(6.02*(10**(23)))))
