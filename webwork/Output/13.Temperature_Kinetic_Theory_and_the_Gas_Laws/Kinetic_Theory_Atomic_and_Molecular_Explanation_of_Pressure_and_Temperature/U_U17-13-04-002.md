## Question Section 

<b>
Average atomic and molecular speeds are large, even at low temperatures. What is v<sub>rms<sub> for helium atoms at(temp)(K)? Helium has(4.003times 10^-3)(kgmol).
ans_rule(40)(ms)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
temp = randrange(4,9,0.1)

A1 = sqrt((3)*(1.38*(10**(-23)))*(temp)/((0.004003)/(6.02*(10**(23)))))
