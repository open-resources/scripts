## Question Section 

<b>
Nuclear fusion, the energy source of the Sun, hydrogen bombs, and fusion reactors, occurs much more readily when the average kinetic energy of the atoms is highâ€”that is, at high temperatures. Suppose you want the atoms in your fusion experiment to have average kinetic energies of(energytimes 10^-14)(J) . What temperature is needed?
ans_rule(40)(K)



## Answer Section

from random import randrange
energy = randrange(5,9,0.01)

A1 = (2/3)*(energy)/(1.38*(10**(-9)))
