## Question Section 

<b>
The escape velocity of any object from Earth is(11.2)(kms). 
a) Express this speed in(ms).
b) At what temperature would oxygen molecules having a molecular mass equal to(Mtimes 10^-2)(kgmol) have an average velocity equal to Earth's escape velocity of(11.2)(kms)?

## A
Express this speed in(ms).
### Answer Section
## B
At what temperature would oxygen molecules having a molecular mass equal to(Mtimes 10^-2)(kgmol) have an average velocity equal to Earth's escape velocity of(11.2)(kms)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

M = sprintf("%0.2f",3.2)
A1 = 11200
A2 = ((M*0.01)*(11200**2))/(3*8.314)
