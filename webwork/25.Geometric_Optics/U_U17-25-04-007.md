## Question Section 

<b>
A ray of light, emitted beneath the surface of an unknown liquid with air above it, undergoes total internal reflection as shown in the figure above. What is the index of refraction for the liquid?
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

n_air = 1
hypotenuse = sqrt(0.15**2+0.134**2)
opposite = 0.134

n_unknown = (n_air)*(hypotenuse/opposite)
