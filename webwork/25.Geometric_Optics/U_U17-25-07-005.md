## Question Section 

<b>
What is the focal length of a makeup mirror that produces a magnification of(magnification) when a person's face is(object_distance)(cm) away?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
magnification = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(2,2.5,0.01))
object_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(10,15,0.1))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

focal_lengthSI = (object_distanceSI)/(1-magnification**-1)
