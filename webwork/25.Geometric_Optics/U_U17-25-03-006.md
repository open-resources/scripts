## Question Section 

<b>
A scuba diver training in a pool looks at his instructor as shown in the figure above. What angle does the ray from the instructor's face make with the perpendicular to the water at the point where the ray enters? The angle between the ray in the water and the perpendicular to the water is(theta_water_degrees^circ). Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1
n_water = 1.333
theta_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(25,30,0.1))
theta_water_rads = theta_water_degrees*(pi/180)

theta_air_rads = asin((n_water/n_air)*sin(theta_water_rads))
theta_air_degrees = theta_air_rads*(180/pi)
