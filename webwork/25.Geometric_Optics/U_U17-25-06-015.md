### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(19,20,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-2
object_distance = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(9,10,0.1))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**3
object_heightSI = randrange(900,1000,1)

image_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*object_distanceSI)/(object_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = (-image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
image_heightSI = (magnification*object_heightSI)
