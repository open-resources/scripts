## Question Section 

<b>
On the Moon's surface, lunar astronauts placed a corner reflector, off which a laser beam is periodically reflected. The distance to the Moon is calculated from the round-trip time. What percent correction is needed to account for the delay in time due to the slowing of light in the Earth's atmosphere? Assume the distance to the Moon is precisely(distance_moontimes 10^8)(m) , and Earth's atmosphere (which varies in density with altitude) is equivalent to a layer(distance_atmosphere)(km) thick with a constant index of refraction equal to(n_atmosphere).
ans_rule(40)(%)
## E
is equivalent to a layer(distance_atmosphere)(km) thick with a constant index of refraction equal to(n_atmosphere).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_atmosphere = sprintf("%0.6f", randrange(1,1.001,0.000001))
distance_atmosphere = sprintf("%0.3f", randrange(16,17,0.001))
distance_atmosphereSI = distance_atmosphere*10**3
distance_moon = 3.844
distance_moonSI = distance_moon*10**8

ratio = ((distance_atmosphereSI)*(n_atmosphere-1))/(distance_moonSI)
percent = ratio*100
