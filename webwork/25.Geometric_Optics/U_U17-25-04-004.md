## Question Section 

<b>
At what minimum angle will you get total internal reflection of light traveling in water and reflected from ice? The index of refraction for water is(n_water) and for ice is(n_ice).
ans_rule(40) &#176;


## Answer Section

n_ice = 1.309
n_water = 1.333

critical_angle_rads = asin(n_ice/n_water)
critical_angle_degrees = critical_angle_rads*(180/pi)
