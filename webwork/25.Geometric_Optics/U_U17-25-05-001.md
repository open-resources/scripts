<b>
a) What is the ratio of the speed of red light to violet light in diamond? The index of refraction for the violet light in diamond is(n_violet_diamond) and the red light is(n_red_diamond).
ans_rule(40) 
b) What is this ratio in polystyrene? Violet light has an index of refraction equal to(n_violet_polystyrene) and red light has a value of(n_red_polystyrene).
ans_rule(40)
## A
What is the ratio of the speed of red light to violet light in diamond? The index of refraction for the violet light in diamond is(n_violet_diamond) and the red light is(n_red_diamond).
### Answer Section
## B
What is this ratio in polystyrene? Violet light has an index of refraction equal to(n_violet_polystyrene) and red light has a value of(n_red_polystyrene).
### Answer Section
## D
and the red light is(n_red_diamond).
### Answer Section
## E
and red light has a value of(n_red_polystyrene).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

n_red_diamond = sprintf("%0.3f", 2.410)
n_red_polystyrene = 1.488
n_violet_diamond = 2.458
n_violet_polystyrene = 1.506

ratio_diamond = (n_violet_diamond)/(n_red_diamond)
ratio_polystyrene = (n_violet_polystyrene)/(n_red_polystyrene)
