## Question Section 

<b>
Suppose you are using total internal reflection to make an efficient corner reflector. If there is air outside and the incident angle is(critical_angle_degrees^circ), what must be the minimum index of refraction of the material from which the reflector is made? The index of refraction for air is equal to(n_air).
ans_rule(40)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_air = 1.00293
critical_angle_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,0.1))
critical_angle_rads = critical_angle_degrees*(pi/180)

n_unknown = (n_air)/sin(critical_angle_rads)
