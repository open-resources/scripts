## Question Section 

<b>
A ray of(610)(nm) orange light goes from air into fused quartz at an incident angle of(theta_incident_orange_degrees^circ). At what incident angle must(470)(nm) blue light enter flint glass to have the same angle of refraction? The index of refraction in fused quartz for orange light is(n_orange_quartz) and for blue light in flint glass is(n_blue_glass).
ans_rule(40) &#176;


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_orange_quartz = 1.456
n_blue_glass = 1.684 
do {
theta_incident_orange_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(55,60,0.1))
theta_incident_orange_rads = theta_incident_orange_degrees*(pi/180)
} until (abs((n_blue_glass/n_orange_quartz)*sin(theta_incident_orange_rads)) < 1)

theta_incident_blue_rads = asin((n_blue_glass/n_orange_quartz)*sin(theta_incident_orange_rads))
theta_incident_blue_degrees = theta_incident_blue_rads*(180/pi)
