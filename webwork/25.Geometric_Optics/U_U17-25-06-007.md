### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(15,20,0.01))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-2
object_distance = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(7.5,12.5,0.01))
object_distanceSI = object_distance*10**-2

diameter_mole = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(5,10,0.01))

image_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*object_distanceSI)/(object_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = -(image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)

diameter_mole_magnified = diameter_mole*abs(magnification)
