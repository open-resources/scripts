## Question Section 

<b>
Some telephoto cameras use a mirror rather than a lens. What radius of curvature mirror is needed to replace a(focal_length)(mm) focal length telephoto lens?
ans_rule(40)(m)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = randrange(700,800,1)
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3

radius_of_curvatureSI = 2*focal_lengthSI
