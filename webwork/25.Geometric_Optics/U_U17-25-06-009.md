ans_rule(40)(m)
## A
How far from the lens must the film be?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(85,90,0.1))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-3
object_distanceSI = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(1,5,0.01))
film_height = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(45,50,0.1))
film_heightSI = film_height*10**-3

image_distanceSI = (focal_lengthSI*object_distanceSI)/(object_distanceSI-focal_lengthSI)
magnification = (image_distanceSI/object_distanceSI)
object_heightSI = (film_heightSI/magnification)
