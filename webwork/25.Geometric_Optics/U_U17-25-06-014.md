## Answer Section

from random import randrange
focal_length = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(11,11.5,0.01))
focal_lengthSI = focal_length*10**-2
object_distance_a = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(8,8.5,0.01))
object_distance_aSI = object_distance_a*10**-2
object_distance_b = sprintf("%0.2f", randrange(9.5,10,0.01))
object_distance_bSI = object_distance_b*10**-2

magnification_a = (1-(object_distance_aSI/focal_lengthSI))**-1
magnification_b = (1-(object_distance_bSI/focal_lengthSI))**-1
