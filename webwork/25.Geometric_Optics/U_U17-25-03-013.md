## Question Section 

<b>
<b>Unreasonable Results:<b> Suppose light travels from water to another substance, with an angle of incidence of(theta_water_degrees^circ) and an angle of refraction of (theta_unknown_degrees^circ). What is the index of refraction of the other substance? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).

## C
and an angle of refraction of (theta_unknown_degrees^circ). What is the index of refraction of the other substance? Water has an index of refraction equal to(n_water).
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
n_water = 1.333
theta_water_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(5,10,0.1))
theta_water_rads = theta_water_degrees*(pi/180)
theta_unknown_degrees = sprintf("%0.1f", randrange(15,20,0.1))
theta_unknown_rads = theta_unknown_degrees*(pi/180)

n_unknown = (n_water)*(sin(theta_water_rads)/sin(theta_unknown_rads))
