## Question Section 

A North American tourist takes his(W,(W),(V1,(V) AC razor to Europe, finds a special adapter, and plugs it into(V2,(V) AC. Assuming constant resistance, what power does the razor consume as it is ruined?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


W = randrange(20,30,5)
V1 = randrange(110,130,10)
V2 = V1*2
R = (V1**2)/W
E = (V2**2)/R
