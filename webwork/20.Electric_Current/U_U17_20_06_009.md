## Question Section 

A short circuit in a(V,(V) appliance cord has a(R,(Omega) resistance. Calculate the temperature rise of the(mass,(g) of surrounding materials, assuming their specific heat capacity is(heatc)(calg)(cdot)(^circ(C) and that it takes(t,(s) for a circuit breaker to interrupt the current.
## A
resistance. Calculate the temperature rise of the(mass,(g) of surrounding materials, assuming their specific heat capacity is(heatc)(calg)(cdot)(^circ(C) and that it takes(t,(s) for a circuit breaker to interrupt the current.
### Answer Section
## G
of surrounding materials, assuming their specific heat capacity is(heatc)(calg)(cdot)(^circ(C) and that it takes(t,(s) for a circuit breaker to interrupt the current.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

V = randrange(115,125,5)
R = randrange(0.490,0.510,0.010)
mass = randrange(1,3,1)
heatc = randrange(0.190,0.210,0.010)
t = randrange(0.0475,0.0525,0.0025)
J = ((V**2)/R)*t
E = J/(mass*heatc*4.186)
