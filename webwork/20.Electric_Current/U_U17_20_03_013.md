## Question Section 

A copper wire has a resistance of(Rc)(Omega) at(T^circ(C), and an iron wire has a resistance of(Ri)(Omega) at the same temperature. At what temperature are their resistances equal?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


T = randrange(18,22,1)
Rc = randrange(0.480,0.500,0.005)
Ri = randrange(0.525,0.545,0.005)
cT = (Rc-Ri)/(Ri*(5*10**-3)-Rc*(3.9*10**-3))
E = T+cT
