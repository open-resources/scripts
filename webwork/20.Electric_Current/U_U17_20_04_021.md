## Question Section 

a) What energy is dissipated by a lightning bolt having a(A,(A) current, a voltage of(V)(times 10^2,(MV) , and a length of(T,(ms)?
b) What mass of tree sap could be raised from(t^circ(C) to its boiling point and then evaporated by this energy, assuming sap has the same thermal characteristics as water?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


V = randrange(0.996,1.04,0.002)
A = randrange(19500,20500,250)
T = randrange(0.91,1.09,0.03)
t = randrange(17,19,0.5)
E = A*(V*10**8)*(T*10**-3)
F = E/((2256*10**3)+(4186*(100-t)))
