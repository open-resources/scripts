## Question Section 

A resistor made of Nichrome wire is used in an application where its resistance cannot change more than(1.00,(%) from its value at(T^circ(C) . Over what temperature range can it be used?
Low End
High End


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


T = randrange(18.5,21.5,0.5)
E = T-25
F = T+25
