## Question Section 

A defibrillator sends a(A,(A) current through the chest of a patient by applying a(V,(V) potential. What is the resistance of the path?
(Omega)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(5.64,6.18,0.06)
V = randrange(9800,10200,100)
E = (V/A)/10**3
