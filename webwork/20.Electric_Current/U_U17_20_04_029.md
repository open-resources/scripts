## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


masswater = randrange(1450,1550,25)
T1 = randrange(8,12,1)
T2 = randrange(38,42,1)
eff = randrange(70,80,5)
cost = randrange(8,10,1)
volt = randrange(210,230,10)
t = randrange(3,5,1)
Q = (masswater*4186*(T2-T1))/(eff*10**-2)
E = (Q/(3.6*10**6))*(cost*10**-2)
F = Q/(volt*(t*3600))
