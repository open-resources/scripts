## Question Section 

A large cyclotron directs a beam of(He)<sup>++<sup> nuclei onto a target with a beam current of(A,(mA).
a) How many(He)<sup>++<sup> nuclei per second is this?
b) How long does it take for(C,(C) to strike the target?
c) How long before(M) mol of(He)<sup>++<sup> nuclei strike the target?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3

A = randrange(0.225,0.275,0.005)
C = randrange(0.82,1.36,0.009)
M = randrange(0.82,1.36,0.009)
E = (A*10**-3)/(2*(1.6*10**-19))
F = C/(A*10**-3)
G = (M*(6.02*10**23))/(E)
