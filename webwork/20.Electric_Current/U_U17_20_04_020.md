## Question Section 

Cold vaporizers pass a current through water, evaporating it with only a small increase in temperature. One such home device is rated at(A,(A) and utilizes(V,(V) AC with(C,(%) efficiency.
a) What is the vaporization rate in grams per minute? 
b) How much water must you put into the vaporizer for(T,(h) of overnight operation?

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


C = randrange(93.4,95.8,0.4)
V = randrange(110,130,5)
A = randrange(2.90,3.50,0.1)
T = randrange(7.4,8.4,0.2)
P = (A*V)*10**-3
E = (((C*10**-2)*P*60)/2256)*10**3
F = ((T*60)*E)*10**-3
