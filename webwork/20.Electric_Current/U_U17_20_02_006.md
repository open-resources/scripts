## Question Section 

A power transmission line is hung from metal towers with  glass insulators having a resistance of(R)(times 10^9)(Omega) . What current flows through the insulator if the voltage is(V,(kV)? (Some high-voltage lines are DC.)

### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


R = randrange(1.00,1.05,0.01)
V = randrange(196,204,2)
E = ((V*10**3)/(R*10**9))*10**3
