## Question Section 

A gold wire is made, it has a resistance of(77.7)(Omega) at(20.0^circ(C). What is its resistance at(T^circ(C)?
## A
at(20.0^circ(C). What is its resistance at(T^circ(C)?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


T = randrange(138,162,4)
E = (77.7)*(1+(3.4*10**-3)*(T-20))
