## Question Section 

The diameter of 0-gauge copper wire is(d,(mm). Find the resistance of a(L,(km) length of such wire used for power transmission.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


L = randrange(0.79,1.21,0.07)
d = randrange(8.237,8.267,0.005)
E = ((L*10**3)*(1.72*10**-8))/(pi*((d*10**-3)/2)**2)
