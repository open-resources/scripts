## Question Section 

Digital medical thermometers determine temperature by measuring the resistance of a semiconductor device called a thermistor (which has(alpha) =(a) (^circ(C) ) when it is at the same temperature as the patient. What is a patient's temperature if the thermistor's resistance at that temperature is(P,(%) of its value at(T^circ(C) (normal body temperature)?
## A

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


a = randrange(-0.0605,-0.0595,0.0001)
P = randrange(78,86,2)
T = randrange(36.5,37.5,0.1)
cP = (-1)*(1-(P*10**-2))
cT = cP/a
E = T+cT
