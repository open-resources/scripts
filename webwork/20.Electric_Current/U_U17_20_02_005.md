## Question Section 

a) Find the voltage drop in an extension cord having a(Ra)(Omega) resistance and through which(A,(A) is flowing.
b) A cheaper cord utilizes thinner wire and has a resistance of(Rb)(Omega) . What is the voltage drop in it when(A,(A) flows?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
showHint = 3


Ra = randrange(0.0568,0.0632,0.0008)
Rb = randrange(0.282,0.318,0.006)
A = randrange(4.73,5.18,0.09)
E = A*Ra
F = A*Rb
