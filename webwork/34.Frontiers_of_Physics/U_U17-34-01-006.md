## Question Section 

Our solar system orbits the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. Assuming a circular orbit(radius) ly in radius and an orbital speed of(velocity) kms, how many years does it take for one revolution? Note that this is approximate, assuming constant speed and circular orbit, but it is representative of the time for our system and local stars to make one revolution around the galaxy.
