## Question Section 

The free throw line in basketball is(d,m) ((15,(ft)) from the basket, which is(h,m) ((10,(ft)) above the floor. A player standing on the free throw line throws the ball with an initial speed of(vo,ms), releasing it at a height of(ho,m) ((8,(ft)) above the floor. At what angle above the horizontal must the ball be thrown to exactly hit the basket?
Note that most players will use a large initial angle rather than a flat shot because it allows for a larger margin of error.

## Answer Section

d = 4.57
h = 3.05
vo = 8.15
ho = 2.44

A = atan(2.3796)*180/pi
