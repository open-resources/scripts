## Question Section 

A daredevil is attempting to jump his motorcycle over a line of buses parked end to end by driving up a  (a^circ) ramp at a speed of(v,ms).
How many buses can he clear if the top of the takeoff ramp is at the same height as the bus tops and the buses are(20.0,(m) long?
ans_rule(40) buses

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(35,45,1)
a = randrange(30,35,1)
g = 9.8

R = (v**2*sin(2*pi/180*a))/g
N = R/20
