## Question Section 

Bryan Allen pedaled a human-powered aircraft across the English Channel from the cliffs of Dover to Cap Gris-Nez on June 12, 1979.
a) He flew for(169,(min) at an average velocity of(3.53,(ms) in a direction south of east. What was his total displacement?
b) Allen encountered a headwind averaging(2.00,(ms) almost precisely in the opposite direction of his motion relative to the Earth. What was his average velocity relative to the air?
c) What was his total displacement relative to the air mass?

## Answer Section

A = 35.8
B = 5.53
C = 56.1
