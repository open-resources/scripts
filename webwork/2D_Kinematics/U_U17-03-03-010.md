## Question Section 

An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at(v,(ms) while falling(h,(m) vertically. Relative to the Earth, how far will the coin travel horizontally?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(257,263,1)
h = randrange(1.47,1.53,0.01)
A1 = sqrt(2*h/9.8)*v
