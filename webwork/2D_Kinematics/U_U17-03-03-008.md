## Question Section 

A seagull flies at a velocity of(v,ms) straight into the wind.
a) If it takes the bird(t,min) to travel(d,km) relative to the Earth, what is the velocity of the wind?
b) If the bird turns around and flies with the wind, how long will he take to return(d,km)?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(8.5,9.5,0.1)
t = randrange(18,22,1)
d = randrange(5.7,6.3,0.1)
A1 = d*1000/(t*60)-v
A2 = d*1000/(-A1+v)*1/60
