## Question Section 

Suppose you walk( w,m) straight west and then( n,m) straight north. 
a) How far are you from your starting point?
b) What is the compass direction of a line  connecting your starting point to your final position?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
w = randrange(15,20,1)
n = randrange(20,25,1)

A1 = sqrt(w**2+n**2)
A2 = 90-arctan(n/w)*180/(pi)
