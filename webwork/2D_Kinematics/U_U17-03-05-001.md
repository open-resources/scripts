Given that each block is(120,m) on a side, find the following for path A in the above image:
a) the total distance travelled
b) the magnitude and direction of displacement from start to finish.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
a = randrange(5,30,0.1)
b = randrange(5,30,0.1)

A1 = 480
s = 120**2
h = 360**2
A2 = sqrt(s+h)
A3 = atan(120/360)*180/pi
