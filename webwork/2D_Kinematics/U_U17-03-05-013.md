a) Use the distance and velocity data in the above image to find the rate of expansion as a function of distance.
(10^-18)(s^-1)
b) If you extrapolate back in time, how long ago would all of the galaxies have been at approximately the same position?
The two parts of this problem give you some idea of how the Hubble constant for universal expansion and the time back to the Big Bang are determined, respectively.

## Answer Section

A1 = 1.57
A2 = 2.02*10**10
