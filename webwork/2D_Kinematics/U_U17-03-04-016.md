## Question Section 

An arrow is shot from a height of(h,m) toward a cliff of height(H). It is shot with a velocity of(v,ms) at an angle of(a^circ) above the horizontal. It lands on the top edge of the cliff(t,s) later.
a) What is the height of the cliff?
b) What is the maximum height reached by the arrow along its trajectory?
c) What is the arrow's impact speed just before hitting the cliff?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h = randrange(1.2,1.5,0.1)
v = randrange(27,34,1)
a = randrange(56,62,1)
A = a*pi/180
t = randrange(3,5,0.2)
g = 9.8

voy = v*sin(A)

vx = v*cos(A)

H = h+(voy*t)-(0.5*g*t**2)
vfy = sqrt(voy**2-2*g*(H-h))
Hm = h+(voy**2)/(2*g)
vf = sqrt(vfy**2+vx**2)
