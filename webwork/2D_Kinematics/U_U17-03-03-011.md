## Question Section 

A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of(v,ms) when he throws a pass to a player(d,m) straight downfield. The ball is thrown at an angle of(a^circ) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released. What is the initial velocity of the ball relative to the quarterback?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
v = randrange(1.7,2.2,0.1)
d = randrange(16,20,0.5)
a = randrange(22,27,1)
s = sqrt(d*9.8/(sin(2*a*pi/180)))
x = v+s*cos(a*pi/180)
y = s*sin(a*pi/180)
p1 = (x)**2
p2 = (y)**2

A1 = sqrt(p1+p2)
A2 = atan(y/x)*180/pi
