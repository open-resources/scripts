## Question Section 

A football player punts the ball at a(45^circ) angle. Without an effect from the wind, the ball would travel(d.0,(m) horizontally.
a) What is the initial speed of the ball?
b) When the ball is near its maximum height it experiences a brief gust of wind that reduces its horizontal velocity by(v,(ms). What distance does the ball travel horizontally?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
d = randrange(57,63,1)

A1 = sqrt(d*9.8)
t = (d/2)/(A1)
v = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.1)
A2 = (A1-v)*t
