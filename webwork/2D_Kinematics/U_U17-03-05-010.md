## Question Section 

A sandal is dropped from the top of a(h,m) high mast on a ship moving at(v,ms) due south. Calculate the velocity of the sandal when it hits the deck of the ship:
a) relative to the ship and
b) relative to a stationary observer on shore.

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
h= randrange(12,16,1)
v = randrange(1.6,1.8,0.01)


A1 = sqrt(2*9.8*h)
A2 = sqrt((v)**2+2*9.8*h)
A3 = atan(A1/v)*180/pi
