## Question Section 

An AC appliance cord has its hot and neutral wires separated by(distance,(mm) and carries a(current,(A) current.
a) What is the average force per metre between the wires in the cord?
b) What is the maximum force per metre between the wires?
## A
What is the average force per metre between the wires in the cord?
### Answer Section
## B
What is the maximum force per metre between the wires?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
current = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = ((4*pi*10**-7)*current**2)/(2*pi*(distance*10**-3))
F = E*2
