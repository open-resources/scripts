## Question Section 

To construct a nonmechanical water meter, a(strength,(T) magnetic field is placed across the supply water pipe to a home and the Hall voltage is recorded.
a) Find the flow rate in liters per second through a(diameter,(cm) diameter pipe if the Hall voltage is(voltage,(mV).
b) What would the Hall voltage be for the same flow rate through a(diameter_b,(cm) diameter pipe with the same field applied?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(0.490,0.510,0.001)
diameter = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
voltage = randrange(59.5,60.5,0.1)
diameter_b = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
E = (pi*(((diameter*10**-2)/2)**2)*(voltage*10**-3))/(strength*(diameter*10**-2))
F = (4*strength*E)/(pi*(diameter_b*10**-2))
