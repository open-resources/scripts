## Question Section 

What is the speed of a supersonic aircraft with a(wingspan,(m) wingspan, if it experiences a(voltage,(V) Hall voltage between its wing tips when in level flight over the north magnetic pole, where the Earth's field strength is(strength)(times 10^-5,(T)?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(1.55,1.65,0.01)
strength = randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01)
wingspan = randrange(16.5,17.5,0.1)
E = voltage/((strength*10**-5)*wingspan)
