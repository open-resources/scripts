## Question Section 

What would the Hall voltage be if a(strength,(T) field is applied across a 10-gauge copper wire ((diameter,(mm) in diameter) carrying a(current,(A) current? The number density of charge for copper is(8.34times 10^28)(em^3)


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
strength = randrange(1.95,2.05,0.01)
diameter = randrange(2.583,2.593,0.001)
current = randrange(1.95,20.5,0.1)
E = 4*((current*strength)/((8.34*10**28)*pi*(1.6*10**-19)*(diameter*10**-3)))*10**6
