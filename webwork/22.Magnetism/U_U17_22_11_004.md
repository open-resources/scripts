## Question Section 

a) To see why an MRI utilizes iron to increase the magnetic field created by a coil, calculate the current needed in a(loops)-loop-per-meter circular coil(0.660,(m) in radius to create a(strength,(T) field (typical of an MRI instrument) at its center with no iron present.
b) The magnetic field of a proton is approximately like that of a circular current loop(radius)(times 10^-15,(m) in radius carrying(current)(times 10^4,(A) . What is the field at the center of such a loop?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
loops = randrange(375,425,5)
strength = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
radius = randrange(0.645,0.655,0.001)
current = randrange(1.00,1.10,0.01)
E = strength/((4*pi*10**-7)*loops)
F = ((4*pi*10**-7)*(current*10**4))/(2*(radius*10**-15))
