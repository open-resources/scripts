## Question Section 

A cosmic ray proton moving toward the Earth at(speed)(times 10^7,(ms) experiences a magnetic force of(force)(times 10^-16,(N) . What is the strength of the magnetic field if there is a(angle^circ) angle between it and the proton's velocity?
## C
angle between it and the proton's velocity?
### Answer Section


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
force = randrange(1.65,1.75,0.01)
angle = randrange(42,48,1)
angle_radian = (angle*pi)/180
E = (force*10**-16)/((1.6*10**-19)*(speed*10**7)*sin(angle_radian))
