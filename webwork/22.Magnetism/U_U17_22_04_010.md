## Question Section 

An electron moving at(speed)(times 10^3,(ms) in a(T,(T) magnetic field experiences a magnetic force of(force)(times 10^-16,(N) . What angle does the velocity of the electron make with the magnetic field?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(3.95,4.05,0.01)
T = randrange(1.2,1.3,0.01)
force = randrange(1.35,1.45,0.01)
E = (asin((force*10**-16)/((1.6*10**-19)*(speed*10**3)*T)))*180/pi
