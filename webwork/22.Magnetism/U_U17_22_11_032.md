## Question Section 

A surveyor(distance,(m) from a long straight(200,(kV) DC power line suspects that its magnetic field may equal that of the Earth and affect compass readings.
Calculate the wire needed to create a(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) current in the field at this distance.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
distance = randrange(90,110,1)
strength = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
E = ((2*pi*distance*(strength*10**-5))/(4*pi*10**-7))*10**-3
