## Question Section 

Frustrated by the small Hall voltage obtained in blood flow measurements, a medical physicist decides to increase the applied magnetic field strength to get a(voltage,(V) output for blood moving at(speed,(cms) in a(diameter,(cm) diameter vessel.
What magnetic field strength is needed?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
voltage = randrange(0.495,0.505,0.001)
speed = randrange(29.5,30.5,0.1)
diameter = randrange(1.45,1.55,0.01)
E = voltage/((diameter*10**-2)*(speed*10**-2))
