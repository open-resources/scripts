## Question Section 

Inside a motor,(current) A passes through a(turns) turn circular loop that is(radius,(cm) in radius. What is the magnetic field strength created at its center?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(225,275,5)
current = randrange(29.5,30.5,0.1)
radius = randrange(9.5,10.5,0.1)
E = (turns*(4*pi*10**-7)*current)/(2*(radius*10**-2))
