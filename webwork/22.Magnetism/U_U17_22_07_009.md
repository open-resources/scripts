## Question Section 

a) What is the angle between a wire carrying an(current,(A) current and the(strength,(T) field it is in if(length,(cm) of the wire experiences a magnetic force of(force,(N)?
b) What is the force on the wire if it is rotated to make an angle of(90^circ) with the field?
## A

from random import randrange
current = randrange(7.95,8.05,0.01)
strength = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
length = randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1)
force = randrange(2.35,2.45,0.01)
E = (asin(force/(current*(length*10**-2)*strength)))*180/pi
F = current*(length*10**-2)*strength
