## Question Section 

a) A(turns)-turn circular loop of radius(radius,(cm) is vertical, with its axis on an east-west line. A current of(current,(A) circulates clockwise in the loop when viewed from the east. The Earth's field here is due north, parallel to the ground, with a strength of(strength)(times 10^-5,(T). What is the magnitude of the torque on the loop?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
turns = randrange(190,210,5)
radius = randrange(49.5,50.5,0.1)
current = randrange(95,105,1)
strength = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
E = turns*current*pi*((radius*10**-2)**2)*(strength*10**-5)
