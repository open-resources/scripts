## Question Section 

a) An oxygen-16 ion with a mass of(masstimes 10^-26,(kg) travels at(speed)(times 10^6,(ms) perpendicular to a(T,(T) magnetic field, which makes it move in a circular arc with a(radius,(m) radius. What positive charge is on the ion?
(C)
b) What is the ratio of this charge to the charge of an electron?

## Answer Section

from random import randrange
charge = 3
mass = 2.656
speed = randrange(4.95,5.05,0.01)
T = randrange(1.15,1.25,0.01)
radius = mass*10**(-26)*speed*10**6/(charge*1.6*10**(-19)*T)
E = ((mass*10**(-6))*(speed*10**5))/(radius*T)
F = E/(1.6)
