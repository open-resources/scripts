## Question Section 

Find the current through a loop needed to create a maximum torque of(torque,(Nm). The loop has(turns) square turns that are(length,(cm) on a side and is in a uniform(strength,(T) magnetic field.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
torque = randrange(8.75,9.25,0.05)
turns = randrange(40,60,5)
length = randrange(14.5,15.5,0.1)
strength = randrange(0.790,0.810,0.001)
E = torque/(turns*((length*10**-2)**2)*strength)
