## Question Section 

What radius circular path does an electron travel if it moves at(speed)(times 10^7,(ms) perpendicular to a(T,(T) magnetic field.


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
speed = randrange(7.45,7.55,0.01)
T = randrange(0.975,0.983,0.001)
E = ((9.11*10**-31)*(speed*10**7))/((1.6*10**-19)*T)
