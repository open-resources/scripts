## Question Section 

What is the force per meter on a lightning bolt at the equator that carries(current,(A) perpendicular to the Earth's(strength)(times 10^-5,(T) field?


## Answer Section

from random import randrange
current = randrange(19000,21000,100)
strength = randrange(2.95,3.05,0.01)
E = current*(strength*10**-5)
